Working out the image (and therefore knowing whether the page has changed):

1) Look at the largest image. This works most of the time.

2) Look for a redirect to a canonical URL - e.g. explosm.net/comics to
explosm.net/comics/2452, order of the stick

3) Look for some sort of update - e.g. 2dgoggles.com

4) Check the status of some other image - e.g. dresdencodak.com,
abominable.cc, sisterclaire.com, somethingpositive.net, sluggy.com, wondermark

5) Cope with HTTP::Async not coping with https URLs -
e.g. ubersoft.net/comic/hd 

6) Cope with webcomics requiring a click-through - e.g. oglaf

7) Improve performance by not fetching paypal images - done?

8) Let people choose whether to see news or not.

Working out canonical URLs

Evil-comic mixes news and comics, as do many others.
No feed for Wonderella
No RSS for dinosaur comics.

doesn't have dates.

Darths and droids finds the feeds for Irregular webcomic instead.
No feed for oglaf.

No feed for El Goonish Shive.
Sluggy only has one entry in the feed.
