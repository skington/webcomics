Working out the image (and therefore knowing whether the page has changed):

1) Look at the largest image. This works most of the time.

2) Look for a redirect to a canonical URL - e.g. explosm.net/comics to
explosm.net/comics/2452, order of the stick

3) Look for some sort of update - e.g. 2dgoggles.com

4) Check the status of some other image - e.g. dresdencodak.com,
abominable.cc, sisterclaire.com, somethingpositive.net, sluggy.com, wondermark

5) Cope with HTTP::Async not coping with https URLs -
e.g. ubersoft.net/comic/hd 

6) Cope with webcomics requiring a click-through - e.g. oglaf

7) Improve performance by not fetching paypal images - done?

8) Let people choose whether to see news or not.

Working out canonical URLs

RSS feed issues:
Doonesbury has a non-Doonesbury-related slate feed
No feed for Dilbert
Narbonic has two feeds, apparently at random.
Skin Horse has two feeds, one for the comic, one for comments. Spinnerette also does this.
So does Frankenstein Superstar.
Evil-comic mixes news and comics, as do many others.
No feed for Wonderella
Dresden Codak uses feedproxy URLs.
Basic Instructions has three feeds in different formats. Nerd.
XKCD doesn't date entries in the Atom feed, but does in RSS.
No RSS for dinosaur comics.
OOTS has titles in the feed that don't figure in the comic.
No feed for full frontal nerdity.
Darths and droids finds the feeds for Irregular webcomic instead.
No feed for oglaf.
No feed for sinfest.
Misfile only has the rants, which is completely fucking pointless.
Gunnerkrigg Court has titles that are always the same.
Something Positive has the date, but also a comic name, in the title.
Scary go round also mixes dates and a common string.
No feed for El Goonish Shive.
Sluggy only has one entry in the feed.
PVP uses feedproxy URLs. A number of other comics may well do this as well.
