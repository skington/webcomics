Working out the image (and therefore knowing whether the page has changed):

1) Look at the largest image. This works most of the time.

2) Look for a redirect to a canonical URL - e.g. explosm.net/comics to
explosm.net/comics/2452, order of the stick, PvP

3) Look for some sort of update - e.g. 2dgoggles.com

4) Check the status of some other image - e.g. dresdencodak.com,
abominable.cc, sisterclaire.com, somethingpositive.net, sluggy.com, wondermark

5) Cope with HTTP::Async not coping with https URLs -
e.g. ubersoft.net/comic/hd 

6) Cope with webcomics requiring a click-through - e.g. oglaf

7) Improve performance by not fetching paypal images - done?

8) Let people choose whether to see news or not.

Working out canonical URLs

RSS feed issues:
Doonesbury has a non-Doonesbury-related slate feed
No feed for Dilbert (but there's a link to it).
Reptilis Rex mixes comics and news; only comics have a large image in the RSS feed.
Dresden Codak mixes comics and news; comics posts have a tag 'Comics', feature images with an empty src attribute - why the hell would you ever do that?
No RSS for dinosaur comics.
No feed for full frontal nerdity.
Darths and droids finds the feeds for Irregular webcomic instead.
No feed for oglaf.
No feed for sinfest.
Gunnerkrigg Court has titles that are always the same, and links to the front page.
No feed for El Goonish Shive.
Sluggy only has one entry in the feed, and links to the front page.

Non-RSS websites:
Doonesbury: confused by useless RSS feed. Link title is 'Prev', href is /strip/archive/yyyy/mm/dd, today's link exists.
Dilbert: comic found correctly as largest image, link, href is /yyyy-mm-dd/, class is 'STR_Prev_PNG_Fix', today's link exists.
Dinosaur comics: doesn't find image for some reason; link, title is 'Previous comic', rel is 'prev', links to /index.php?comic=2169, today's link exists.
Full frontal nerdity: image is /ffn/strips/yyyy-mm-dd.jpg; link to index.php?date=yyyy-mm-dd, contains image back.jpg, today's link exists (well, 6th March as the comic's somewhat on hiatus).
Darths and droids: wrong RSS feed. Link body is '<PREVIOUS', links to /episodes/nnnn.html, today's link exists.
Oglaf: doesn't find image (possibly because requires a click-through). Link is id pvs, class nav_ro, contains an image set by a CSS rule, target is /fireofgod/1 - horrible.
Sinfest: image is /comikaze/comics/yyyy-mm-dd.gif. Link is to /archive_page.php?comicID=nnnn, src images/prev_a.gif, alt Previous. Today's link exists.
Gunnerkrigg Court: link to /archive_page.php?comicID=nnnn, contains img src prev_a.jpg, alt 'Previous'. Today's page exists.
Sluggy: useless RSS feed. Link to /comics/archives/daily/yymmdd, contains image class "ui-icon-seek-prev", text "Prev.". Today's link redirects to front page.
El Goonish Shive: finds correct image, /comics/yyyy/mm/yyyymmdd_....png. Link to /?date=yyyy-mm-dd, contains image src /templates/home/arrow_prev.gif. Today's link exists.
Project Apollo: link to abnnn.html, contains image, alt 'Previous Page', src layout/button-back.png. Page doesn't exist. Site fucked.
