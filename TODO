Working out the image (and therefore knowing whether the page has changed):

1) Look at the largest image. This works most of the time.

2) Look for a redirect to a canonical URL - e.g. explosm.net/comics to
explosm.net/comics/2452, order of the stick, PvP

3) Look for some sort of update - e.g. 2dgoggles.com

4) Check the status of some other image - e.g. dresdencodak.com,
abominable.cc, sisterclaire.com, somethingpositive.net, sluggy.com, wondermark

5) Cope with HTTP::Async not coping with https URLs -
e.g. ubersoft.net/comic/hd 

6) Cope with webcomics requiring a click-through - e.g. oglaf

7) Improve performance by not fetching paypal images - done?

8) Let people choose whether to see news or not.

Working out canonical URLs

RSS feed issues:
Doonesbury has a non-Doonesbury-related slate feed
No feed for Dilbert (but there's a link to it).
Evil-comic mixes news and comics, as do many others.
No RSS for dinosaur comics.
No feed for full frontal nerdity.
Darths and droids finds the feeds for Irregular webcomic instead.
No feed for oglaf.
No feed for sinfest.
Misfile only has the rants, which is completely fucking pointless.
Gunnerkrigg Court has titles that are always the same, and links to the front page.
No feed for El Goonish Shive.
Sluggy only has one entry in the feed, and links to the front page.
