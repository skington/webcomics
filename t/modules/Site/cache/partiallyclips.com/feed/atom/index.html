The idea of photos in a girl&#8217;s bedroom analyzing her relationships with their respective subjects based on how she treated the photos tickles me.</p>
<p>I dated a girl for a brief while whose ex, for financial reasons, still lived in the same house with her (I was at the time suffering from a psychological condition called &#8220;idiocy.&#8221;)  She had dumped him, but all he had to do was make it clear that he was still available, and the first time we had anything even remotely resembling a fight, there he was.  Rebounds tend to suck.</p>
<p>That said, my last rebound was with Mrs. Shoebox, and that was 14 years ago.</p>
<p>Speaking of whom:</p>
<p><strong>MRS. SHOEBOX&#8217;S ASSESSMENT OF TODAY&#8217;S STRIP: </strong><strong><em>*chortlesnort* </em>That&#8217;s fucked up.</strong></p>
<p>Running a bit late, and failed to deliver on the second strip I planned to put up last week.  Sorry about that.  I plead yuletide preparations.  And Killswitch Engage concert.</p>
<p>Hope you guys are enjoying your holiday whatnot!  See you soon!</p>

<p>Originally I was just trying to build a decent joke around the fact that the typical &#8220;how much does it hurt on a scale of 1 to 10&#8243; question (a.k.a. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong-Baker_FACES_Pain_Rating_Scale">Wong-Baker FACES Pain-rating scale</a>, apparently) has no units, with the more-universal &#8220;millisharpstickintheeye&#8221; joke as the punchline.  But somehow I couldn&#8217;t make that work, so I&#8217;m taking the risk of ending with a head-scratcher.  Hoping those of you outside the software world, or those of you in said world who haven&#8217;t experienced the glory of Planning Poker, will still find something to enjoy here.  But just in case, there&#8217;ll be another strip up later this week.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

<p><strong>MRS. SHOEBOX&#8217;S ASSESSMENT OF TODAY&#8217;S STRIP: </strong>&#8230;Why is she milking her armpit?</p>
<p>Speaking of the missus, her <a href="http://www.manicmetals.com">Manic Metals</a> store on Etsy is once again stocked with jewelry and other metalcrafts for your holiday shopping pleasure, with new stuff going up several times a week (unlike some of us, I know&#8230;) and she&#8217;s also got a shop with non-metal craft thingies under the name <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SqueeWorthy">Squeeworthy</a>.  For the rest of December, PartiallyClips readers can save 20% in either store by entering in the coupon code CONFLICTOFINTEREST.<br />

<p>I&#8217;ve mocked the lottery for years.  I took prob &amp; stat in college, for crying out loud.  But when I&#8217;m asked to participate in a group ticket purchase at my day job, I still often chip in, and I can&#8217;t properly justify this.  There&#8217;s not a ton of camaraderie or team-building in the collective guessing of numbers, but I guess it&#8217;s still kinda neat to be in the same boat with a bunch of people waiting together for a result.  Even though the positive outcome is hopeless, the negative outcome isn&#8217;t exactly hard to absorb financially, and it&#8217;s something to talk about if nothing else.</p>
<p>I considered rewording this on the basis that the failure of anyone in this classroom to win the lottery doesn&#8217;t actually &#8220;prove&#8221; anything in the mathematical sense, but ultimately decided that the &#8220;assisted me in proving&#8221; wording left me sufficient wiggle room in that department.</p>

<p>I originally wrote this one using clip art that just showed a girl sitting at a desk, and had her interacting with an unseen parent.  But then I accidentally happened upon this piece, and decided to redo the strip.  Something about the parent actually being in the room smiling lovingly down at her child makes the dialog work a lot better, even though it totally looks like she has braces (she doesn&#8217;t &#8211; I&#8217;ve zoomed in.)</p>

<p>Every idea I had with this piece had something to do with video card games becoming the norm and actual physical card games becoming the exception, and once again it was one of those things where every idea became far too wordy to fit in three panels.  The one with cowboys complaining about how a mechanical decision-makin&#8217; contraption could never replace a real player because they wouldn&#8217;t be able to flip a table seemed the most promising, but ultimately I had to pick a direction I could go in without having to connect too many dots.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love the fact that I have a seemingly-unlimited number of games available in my pocket at any given moment.  But there&#8217;s a big difference between sneaking in a few minutes of Words With Friends on your lunch break and having a loud happy evening of Dixit with actual friends.</p>

<p>And, of course, it was sponsored by Red Bull.</p>
<p>I initially thought that putting Red Bull in the strip would be too on-the-nose &#8211; I threw Crystal Pepsi in as the beverage, and then I tried with Zima, but both my wife AND Rob reminded me that it&#8217;s friggin&#8217; 2012.  Rob thought that just sticking with Red Bull was the way to go (and suggested the final &#8220;moon&#8221; line,) and I think he was right.  But, y&#8217;know, Surge would also have totally worked. Just sayin&#8217;.</p>
<p>In other news, for those of you in the NYC area, I&#8217;m playing a show with <a href="http://www.devospice.com">Devo Spice</a> at Broadway&#8217;s in Times Square on Wednesday the 24th (tickets and info <a href="http://www.smarttix.com/show.aspx?showcode=DEV9#.UHwhyquikkE.twitter">here</a>)</p>
