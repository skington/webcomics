		<description>Pro-tip:  the best way to get permanent marker off a dry-erase board is actually with dry-erase markers.  Scribble over the permanent ink with the dry-erase marker then quickly wipe it off before it dries.  That should take both types of ink off in the process.  You have to wipe it before the dry-erase ink dries, though.</description>

		<description>There was a computer game back in the &#039;80&#039;s (I think - maybe the early &#039;90&#039;s) that had battleships with tank treads... drive them to shore and just keep on going... even more slowly of course.
Actually owned/played it, but for the life of me I can&#039;t remember the name.</description>

		<description>If you are referring to Savatage, that band is no longer actively together and producing new music. The band members have either joined other bands, or are concentrating exclusively on TSO.</description>

		<description>So the Santa that won all the belief was the one who attracted the least attention?  

There&#039;s a koan in there (though admittedly, I phrased it that was as a &#039;ice cream&#039; was the human being identifier picture)</description>
