		<description>Ouch. ^^;  That is painful ^^;
Between meatloafs singing, that whole chuck norris &#039;if obama is re-elected a thousand years of darkness will blanket the world&#039; and clint eastwoods furniture arguments it almost seems like sabotage XD 
hmm...i wonder if that could work as an action flick...

Oh and in regards to the reasoning below i want to drop in my own two cents to say that while democrats arn&#039;t contradicting themselves with patriotic freedom, strong christian values and plutocracy
They have a terrible problem with missing opportunities. Like when Democrats had a super majority in congress that could have been used to fix the economy right then and there but mannaged to never get around to it due to attempts at bipartisan-ness and in-the-pockets within their own party. 

Personally I think it would be much simpler if the states just dropped the whole political party logic of democrats or republicans but I somehow suspect that would have its own hurdles. ^^;</description>

		<description>First of all, thank you for asking a question about politics in a polite, civil, honest manner. I mean that without sarcasm- even though the word &quot;hate&quot; may seem a bit inflammatory, I know politics evokes a lot of strong, visceral reactions in people. And they should- politics affect your life, career, family- even the food you eat and the air you breath. For a political question on the internet, yours is very understated.

I knew, getting into my politics in my comic, that people could get offended. Of course, I would like everyone who sees my comic to enjoy it, but I created this comic to have fun AND talk about some real issues. Kind of like Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.
I do not believe in any of this fair and balanced stuff when it comes to Republican/Democrat issues. I believe that the Republican Party has allied itself with multinational corporations, to make every aspect of our lives serve them. I&#039;m sure there are plenty of Democratic politicians in the corporation&#039;s pockets too, but I think they at least have some shame about being bought off. The Republicans have turned greed and Ayn Rand selfishness into their philosophy.
I believe there are two types of Republican- Politicians, who lie, and Republican citizens, who are manipulated by those lies. I think most people in this country want the same things, but there are surface differences, in lifestyle, culture, etc. that separate us. I think Republicans hate Democrats/Liberals because they think we&#039;re hippies or dilettantes or pseudo intellectuals or sissies or leeches who want handouts. And some of us may be. But most of us are mostly like them- we want a nice home, to be able to take good care of our families. To have our children have as good or better a life as we did. To be happy and safe.
Of course, how we do all that is up to debate. 
Democrats know (based on history) that we have to spend, by paying taxes and, via our government, invest in infrastructure, businesses, education, the environment, etc. And we have to provide a safety net for the elderly, sick, and poor.
Republicans believe Capitolism and  the free market will take care of everything. Decent people who run decent businesses and provide good services will rise to the top, and bad ones will be unsupported by consumers and fail. 30+ years of Reaganomics have shown us that giving tax breaks to &quot;job creators&quot; results in the rich getting richer, a shrinking middle class, growing poverty, diminishing infrastructure, education, employment, etc.
Republican Politicians are not conservatives. They are robber barons, and they&#039;re on the wrong side of history, both economically and on social issues. Oppose them. Switch to the winning side. The right side. Which is the Left.</description>

		<description>I guess I did wrong, drawing an arc- because Franky definitely tossed SkatCat too hard. Though I think SkatCat actually bounced off and survived, albeit with every bone in his body broken .</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t get it, what did he do WRONG?
He was told to throw him and he did. He couldn&#039;t have thrown him too hard because he went in an arc whose pinnacle was higher then the place where he landed.</description>
