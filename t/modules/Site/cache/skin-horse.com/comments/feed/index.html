		<description>Plus, they&#039;re not very practical for running during a zombie apocalypse, and they&#039;re not spiky enough for vampire-slaying. With that slope, not even much toe protection against caustic slime. Very poor design.</description>

		<description>He doesn&#039;t fight his clients, he offers them cooperation and unity!

Wait, sorry, I mistyped that. He offers them cooperation OR Unity. You should really cooperate, if you know what&#039;s good for you.</description>

		<description>Can&#039;t be a drone - definition of drone includes male.  Perhaps the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s term for remotes &quot;Waldo&quot; would work.</description>

		<description>Woah, I didn&#039;t notice the zombie eye in the drain at first, I was more concerned with how close Tip was to braking his ankle. His heel was like, teetering on the edge there!</description>

		<description>Doesn&#039;t &quot;a war of reality perception&quot; describe pretty much all politics?
&quot;You didn&#039;t agree to use the Rio Grande as the borderline, you agreed on the Nueces.&quot;
&quot;I am a more down-to-earth Yale graduate and member of Skull and Bones than he is.&quot;
And of course, my current favorite: &quot;My plan of minor tax cuts to an insignificant percentage of the tax base and illusory budget cuts will do more to balance the national budget and boost the economy in general than his plan of minor tax cuts to an insignificant percentage of the tax base and illusory budget cuts.&quot;</description>

		<description>I think people are blending cyber and cyborg.

Cyber is the electronic like you described - brain uploaded, pure hardware and software from that point on.

Cyborg is a mix of wetware and hardware, whether a bionic limb or a full body w/ a brain in a jar (Nick).

Where things REALLY get blurry is when you start programming subroutines into your hardware prosthetics.  Some EXISTING prosthetics (legs pop to mind) respond partly to existing muscles (no nerve interfaces yet) and partly autonomous based on that limited input.  I think i saw a documentary last year about a prosthetic leg that shifted its center of gravity and the &#039;bounce&#039; of the achillies tendon equivalent based on how quickly the owner was walking/running.</description>

		<description>(Tune: Do You Hear What I Hear?)

Said the army &#039;bot to the cross-dressed shrink,
Do you fear what I fear?
(Do you fear what I fear?)
The non-human menace, cross-dressed shrink,
Do you fear what I fear?
(Do you fear what I fear?)

Zombies, zombies, running through this place,
And they want to eat your face.
And they want to eat your face.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;Somewhere&quot; from &lt;i&gt;West Side Story&lt;/i&gt;, Bernstein &amp; Sondheim)

Eat your face today!
Want just a taste today!
Lurching zombies who yearn for brains
Feast on your remains!

Coming through the grate,
It may be too darn late!
Doing this since they found out that
Someone shut down the Brain-O-Mat!
Lurching ... Searching!

&#8195;Soon comes a war of perceiving!
&#8195;Pardon me now, I&#039;ll be leaving,
&#8195;Stage left!

Tip believes he&#039;s right,
He says that he won&#039;t fight
All the people he&#039;s here to serve ...
Then St. Charlie throws him a curve!
Says Bee,
&quot;You&#039;ll see ...
Bite me!&quot;</description>

		<description>VB is completely wrong about Nick.  He is not cybernetic he is hyperprostetic.
Cybernetic would be personality downloaded into a computer.  Nick is a meat brain controlling a mechanical body.</description>

		<description>Let&#039;s see, the woman who is basically a brain-in-a-jar remote-controlling an android being depressed about the future of cybertization based on another brain-in-a-jar controlling a helicopter?

That alone is reason to despair for the future of the human race.  Or to break out in insane laughter.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s a matter of how evolution works. Like Norman and Robert said, if the trait is achieved through genetic manipulation and the specimen is capable of reproduction it would be passed on to successive generations. If the trait is achieved through manipulation of the organism as a whole, it wouldn&#039;t be. Think of Darwin&#039;s finches versus Lamarck&#039;s rats.</description>

		<description>Throw into the mix Mark Stanley&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Freefall&lt;/i&gt;, which seems to suggest: 1) that Florence, the genetically modified wolf, would also have sapient offspring, even though her parents were non-sapient wolves; and 2) that, because of this, these altered &quot;Bowman&#039;s wolves&quot; are &lt;i&gt;intended&lt;/i&gt; to breed with each other.</description>

		<description>No, Sticker Star is an unconscionable piece of shit that stripped out all the franchise&#039;s best elements and completely removed the player&#039;s incentive to get in any fuckin&#039; battles. Miyamoto&#039;s batshit arbitrary decision to prohibit the developers from introducing ANY new characters is evidence that he&#039;s losing a touch we perhaps only imagined he had in the first place. Don&#039;t put your money anywhere near that garbage cash-in, aight?</description>

		<description>Pixelated, not 8 bit. The color Palette was too rich to be 8 bits.

But yes, it&#039;s a great movie, though it raises some serious metaphysical issues regarding arcades and consoles re: intelligent life that are completely outside the basic scope of the story the movie is telling.</description>

		<description>Most of the media coverage seemed to be fluff pieces - hardly anything of substance being discussed.  Alot like going &quot;oh no - the house is burning - what style of uniforms should the firemen wear?&quot;

Lots of agreement on most points, but getting worked up about the incidentals that don&#039;t matter.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t exclude myself from such descriptions - I&#039;ve got opinions of my own after all.  And they do stink as much as everybody elses.

I DO like your finessing of defining the potential as being Nick&#039;s - not that of the program.  We are all trapped into thought paradigms of our own making - even if its only by accepting external paradigms.

Your statement there made me think of the Narbonic re-run now approaching it&#039;s end - where Dave does things using the Lovelace systems that she seemed to be unable to conceive of.

I think it&#039;s possible we could see a transformative Nick at some point - he&#039;s already shown personal growth - from being an antisocial hikikimori to socalizing w/ Marcy and the others, even to heroic behaviour during the Alaska arc and again during the New Orleans trip.  Even to being a nice guy and rescuing his online frienemy from the A-sig roof.</description>

		<description>Thats why I described it as &#039;conflicting&#039;.  Brin, McCaffrey, Weber, Tayler (Schlock Mercenary), Garriety (Narbonic) - Those are the ones that IMMEDIATELY pop to mind.  MOSTLY imply gene mods prior to/part of conception and embrionic development, w/ the traits inherited by subsequent generations.

Lawnmower Man style &#039;uplift&#039; of mature organisms is typically considered not transmitted genetically.

It&#039;s buried in the rest of the novels, but Weber&#039;s Honerverse series has some interesting discussions on the complexities and ramifications of gene mods (such as high gravity mods), including unintended consequences.

Flint/Drake&#039;s Belesarius series (despite it&#039;s Roman-era setting) touches on whether gene mods for environmental adaptations can even be considered human.  Same goes for the Council Wars by John Ringo.

Thats part of why I like the Foster bit I mentioned above.  It&#039;s from one of the Humanx universe Pip&amp;Flinx novels, I should settle down and re-read them again.</description>

		<description>Since we&#039;re talking Mario and Princess Peach, I highly recommend the movie Wreck-It Ralph.  Excellent story, great animation (they put the Disney logo in 8-bit render), and most of it revolves around a racing arcade game.  I&#039;m definitely buying a copy when it comes available.  And the love story in it is great.</description>

		<description>I liked the way Scalzi handled it in Old Man&#039;s War: the soldiers were genetically-engineered to the point that there was zero chance they could breed with standard humans, and sterilized so they couldn&#039;t reproduce with fellow soldiers.  The fact that their blood and genes were patented could also mean that there was a DRM issue involved.</description>

		<description>Dunno about cats, but both of our poodles (one ex-, one current) were fond of Google searching on my wife&#039;s laptop.  And a friend of mine had a 50&quot; iguana that mastered turning off the power strip on her Amiga when he wanted attention.  But that was pre-WWW, so I don&#039;t know if that counts.

Our current poodle is fascinated by bird sounds on TV, we are amused.</description>

		<description>That would be most of the internet, as well as almost everything on MTV and the Speed Channel. 
I have never had a cat who was interested in the internet. I did have two that liked television [one for basketball, the other for commercials that featured human hands]. The one that liked basketball also liked to listen to certain human voices, so he kept playing back my answering machine messages. But I digress...
Why WOULD a cybernetic entity bother complaining about Paper Mario? The game was a clever comment on the absurdity of our three- or four-dimensional world, as viewed through the interactions of a being of &quot;lesser&quot; dimensionality, in which unfavorable interactions lead to a temporary paralysis and loss of personal will...or else it was just a game.</description>

		<description>If VB is considering Nick to be the maximization of cybernetic potential, she needs to look again.  One subject does not a clinical trial make.  At most, this may be &lt;i&gt;Nick&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; maximum potential, assuming she&#039;s even right that he&#039;s reached it.  What other former humans have been uploaded into machines, and what have they achieved?  I would suggest (s)he be the next subject, but I&#039;m fairly sure that (s)he&#039;d still be a bigoted jerk.

As for Nick, I think he&#039;s achieved a lot.  Anasigma tried to make him into a killing machine and a slave.  He said &quot;No&quot;.  If/when Nick reaches his full potential, it will be in the direction he chose, not just being what some bureaucrat (please pardon the profanity, and no offense is intended to the characters Robert the Addeled mentioned) thought he should be.</description>

Brin&#039;s uplifted species, IIRC, were achieved through genetic engineering, but because of an incomplete understanding (they&#039;re still in the process of researching the Prudent Textbook) atavism is still an occasional issue.  Cybernetically enhanced but otherwise &quot;normal&quot; animals likely would breed true to their unaltered genome, if at all.  Creatures enhanced by a nanotech transformation, rebuilding them on a cellular level, might be anywhere in a spectrum from &quot;can&#039;t breed&quot; at one corner to &quot;can breed with original species, producing unaltered offspring&quot; or &quot;can breed with sufficiently similar creatures, producing sapient offspring&quot; at other corners, depending on the intent of the programmer and the limits of the programmer&#039;s knowledge and equipment.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ll reference/paraphrase a A.D.Foster book at this point - an offical communicates it&#039;s agency that there is a threat to the race.  Another character (of a different species) asks which one?  &quot;The race of reason&quot;

Basically implying that Sapient life should stick together - whether they be AI&#039;s, Uplifted gerbils, dolphins, or iguana-men.

BTW - MANY SF authors have conflicting views (in their books) whether uplift can be transferred to offspring.</description>

		<description>The more Violet insists she&#039;s human, the less I believe she is, even slightly. The only problem is that they already did that joke. But what if it&#039;s the same joke? Maybe CONCLUSION REDACTED JUST IN CASE IT&#039;S TRUE.</description>

		<description>OK, Violet B is in full rant mode here...  Hey, I just thought of something.  Given Sergio&#039;s presence, could her trans-homicidal madness be connected to her exposure to Sergio&#039;s gateway?  Perhaps driven mad by exposure to the scope of alternity?  (There&#039;s a Larry Niven story....)</description>

		<description>Destroy?  In case it hasn&#039;t entered their minds already, I&#039;m telling Jeffrey and Shaenon that the best ending is *shipping* H.T./Violet at the end of the strip.

Inflicting domesticity on each other instead of participating in great political causes, seeing their worldviews crumble before an onslaught of unnatural urges and severely confused hormones, this is the proper retribution they each deserve.

Besides, battle androids and tigers need sturdy sex partners each.  It just makes sense.

		<description>Actually, weirdly enough, Violet Bee /isn&#039;t/, by her - or rather his - own admittance, a machine, or even a non-human.  I&#039;m guessing that the shell he&#039;s in is a remote receiver, and his body is stored somewhere in Anasigma Black Ops while it&#039;s not being directly used.  One curious side effect there is that GODOT can&#039;t access his brainwaves, thus preventing him from seeing the writing on the wall.

I further hypothesize that when we later see what Gold Bug /really/ looks like, it&#039;ll be something like Doctor Lee&#039;s avatar at the start of &#039;I Can Fly&#039;.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m starting to get pretty sick of Bee. If she want&#039;s to oppress non-humans simply because they might do something dangerous, then she needs to throw herself onto that boat. She&#039;s a machine. She can probably crush Tip&#039;s neck with little to no effort and shrug off some bullets. If non-humans really do need to be oppressed and controlled, then as a non-human she belongs behind those bars.</description>

		<description>This strip reminds me of the horror I felt upon the 20th anniversary of A New Hope (Star Wars IV) and I realised that there were people of voting age who were born *after* the movie was released!</description>

		<description>I thought the Still Alive idea was a great one (not for this strip, would have been better back when Tip and Artie were confronting HT) so I abandoned all shame and made my own version.


It isn&#039;t science.
I&#039;m making love here, With HUGE SUCCESS.
It&#039;s hard to overstate my satisfaction.

Artie the rodent.
He does whom he must because he can
For the good of all of us
While we we&#039;re on top of his bed.

With his body so oiled that it glistens and gleams
You just keep on lovin&#039; till you run out of steam,
And when the loving is done, you know you&#039;ve had fun
And you feel that you&#039;re still alive.

I&#039;m not even angry.
I&#039;m being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart
And seduced me.

My dress torn to pieces,
And my soul is filled with fire.
As I burn I hurt, because
I was so happy with you!

Despite my confusion
Had a beautiful time
With a human-like rodent
And I&#039;m feeling just fine.

(I end it here due to lazyness.)</description>

And that&#039;s even before you factor the Mads in...</description>

		<description>&quot;Well, there’s kind of a third approach, or more thing that could happen. This from some memories of the &#039;Miracleman&#039; comic; the supers just up and decide to take over. Not in the &#039;Evil, evil!&#039; way, but with benevolent intent, more or less.

&quot;Kind of all depends on how &#039;superhuman&#039; we’re talking though. If you’re talking superpowers like being able to keep things a constant temperature (Kazari Uiharu from “A Certain Scientific Railgun”) just letting them run free might not be a big deal. If you’re talking Superman, you have a walking WMD where you’re at the mercy of his attitude and morality.

This was actually addressed in the &lt;i&gt;Justice League&lt;/i&gt; episode &quot;A Better World&quot;:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Lords

As I recall, it did not end all that well for either the League or the Lords.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t know why Ms. Bee&#039;s so worked up.

Even if there weren&#039;t any super-humans, trans-humans, or other-humans, the species would be in desperate trouble just because of the species.</description>

		<description>There are two main approaches to dealing with superhumans in the existing literature:
VB seems to be in favor of the &quot;they might do us harm, therefor we must lock them up or perhaps destroy them&quot;.  This is seen often in the pages of &lt;i&gt;The X-Men&lt;/i&gt; and related titles.  The problem with this approach is that it encourages Magnetoism.
In most other superhero comics, official policy seems to be &quot;As long as they stay on our side, we leave them alone.&quot;  The problem with this approach is that it often doesn’t leave room for those who just want to be left alone; when told “Yer either with us or agin us!”, a lot of people will say, “If you force me to make that choice, I’m agin ye!”.  More Magnetoism.
I prefer a long term plan:  Treat them as sapient beings with rights equal to all other sapient beings.  Don&#039;t let anyone get away with violating their rights, and don&#039;t let them get away with violating the rights of others.  Hope that they treat us the same way if/when they hold the political power.  The main problem with this plan is it requires that those who currently hold power refrain from using it as they have for lo these many years, to legitimize the violation of some groups rights to benefit a group that supports them, or to play on the fears of their constituents to get reelected.  So I wouldn’t be holding my breath waiting for this option to be taken by any government.</description>

&quot;Do you fear what I fear?
For the human race, transvestite,
Do you fear what I fear?
RT-, RT-
Five four seven eight,
Both his brains and brawn are too great!
Yes, his brains and brawn are too great!&quot;

Said the transvestite to the robo-girl,
&quot;Have you done what I&#039;ve done
With RT-5478?
Have you done what I&#039;ve done?
We kissed!  We hugged!
Also, we made out!
He&#039;s a superhuman, no doubt!
What are you so worried about?</description>

		<description>To immediately bring this down to Junior-High drama level - I&#039;m guessing whomever is running the VB remote HAD a crush on, or had a SO distracted by/stolen by Artie.

I&#039;m still holding out that the interface will become self-aware and that VB will become a SH client</description>

		<description>Maybe it&#039;s just the sleep deprivation, but Tip&#039;s line in panel 4 made me think of the song Still Alive, with the chorus reworded as &quot;I&#039;m doing makeouts, and I&#039;m still alive. Which led to this: 

This was a triumph.
 I&#039;m making a note here: HUGE [REDACTED]
 It&#039;s hard to overstate my satisfaction.
 
RT-5478:
 He does whom he must because he can

And that was the point where my sense of shame kicked in enough to make me stop writing, but not enough to not post it.</description>

		<description>!! Well, it&#039;s just reunion central around here, isn&#039;t it?

&#039;M a bit confused about the first three panels - is he trying out suggestions to see what gets Sergio to react, or are we seeing the same scene run through multiple times with slight variations?</description>

And of COURSE she will run as VP. She has to EAT her superior to consolidate her power in the reptile population; it&#039;s a cultural thing. Whether she survives or he does, it&#039;s a win-win for the scaly agenda.

Giving rise to an entity with G.O.D.O.T.&#039;s omnicidal mania and Ms. Bee&#039;s patriotic anti-abhuman mania.  The result would be something that would not only gain power in the back rooms, but try and eliminate everything, and I mean everything, that isn&#039;t American.</description>

		<description>There&#039;s the Senator, all right, but as that whole strip is essentially &quot;flash forwards&quot;, we have no way of knowing (until now!  thanks for the info, VB!) whether or not that particular incident has happened yet.  Now we know, either Robert Mongorsky is not yet a senator, or not yet half iguana, and therefore not yet carried his wife up a skyscraper ^_^</description>

		<description>Of course, Violet is referring to Senator Robert Mongorsky.
http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/narbonic/series.php?view=archive&amp;chapter=15096&amp;mpe=1&amp;step=1

(scroll over to the right, he&#039;s third from the end)

(TUNE: &quot;Puff The Magic Dragon&quot;, Leonard Lipton and Peter Yarrow)

Senator Mongorsky
Climbed up the tower ...
And made his way, Election Day,
To the corridors of power!
Chair of his committee,
Keeps them on their toes!
On The Hill, he&#039;ll pass his bill
By devouring all his foes!

&#8195;&lt;i&gt;[CHORUS:]&lt;/i&gt;
&#8195;&#8195;Oh,
&#8195;&#8195;Senator Mongorsky
&#8195;&#8195;Lived in a tree ...
&#8195;&#8195;But now debates and legislates
&#8195;&#8195;There in Washington, D.C.!
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&lt;i&gt;(repeat)&lt;/i&gt;

Anasigma&#039;s Violet
Loathed that lizard-man!
She said, &quot;It&#039;s just a crime, I must
Stop him any way I can!
True-blue humans threatened,
Numbered are their days!&quot;
Tip&#039;s reply: &quot;Well, he&#039;s my guy
If he votes for rights for gays!&quot;
&#8195;&lt;i&gt;[repeat CHORUS]&lt;/i&gt;</description>

		<description>Especially when you&#039;re locked up in a cell and a pocket nuke is about to go off.  I doubt if anyone besides Tip and the rest of Team Anasigma is at all likely to let her out.  And I&#039;m not that sure about her teammates.  
Of course, if the person calling them inhuman isn&#039;t actually there, it&#039;s not so crazy ^_^</description>

		<description>Violet is doing an excellent job of illustrating the distinction between mad and crazy. Making &quot;inhumans&quot; is mad. Calling them that on a train full of zombies, mad scientists, and Tip? Crazy.</description>

		<description>Violet&#039;s talking to the wrong person. Given Tip&#039;s day job is working with and for non-human sapients (i.e. not only his clients but his colleagues and his line manager) he&#039;s hardly likely to form the opinion that they shouldn&#039;t gain power.

Oh, and with the current bunch of fully human sapients lurking the corridors of power, some of the non-human sapients might actually do a better job...</description>

		<description>I suspect something&#039;s gotten scrambled and she&#039;s running through lines she prepared back before the Machine Union negotiations, when she assumed Tip would bang her.

Either that or she&#039;s just clueless.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot;, George Michael)

Now you may have guessed,
Now you may suspect ...
It&#039;s time I confessed,
Your love I reject!
You may have had some hope,
But, mister, now it&#039;s gone!
Don&#039;t cry or pout or mope,
Just keep your cute silky panties on!

In spite of the lust
That I see in your eyes,
You can&#039;t touch my bust
And you can&#039;t spread my thighs!
I know that you&#039;re frustrated,
Parts turning blue!
But you won&#039;t get your lust sated,
I&#039;m dumping you!

I want no sex!
I want no love!
I want no ... &lt;i&gt;(bleah!)&lt;/i&gt; sex!</description>

		<description>I honestly think the answer is no, Tip&#039;s answer is not sarcastic, merely insincere. And what Tip does with his eyes isn&#039;t exactly an eye-roll, either. I can&#039;t think of the right phrase for it, but it&#039;s the expression of someone who knows the person he is lying to cannot see his face.</description>

		<description>Well it has been a word for lipstick lately (ten years ago maybe), and a cosmetic powder somewhat like two centuries ago.... In that context, rouge would more likely be understood as &quot;commie&quot;. And to ass to the confusion, some linguists do say that the jolly rogers comes from &quot;joli rouge&quot;.</description>

Sheesh. Teenagers. Put a seatbelt on them and they think it&#039;s okay to rock out with their eyes closed.</description>

		<description>For some reason my first thought went to &quot;Clue,&quot; and while I wouldn&#039;t put it past our humble storytellers to have a character driven by Michael McKean, it seems less likely than most other explanations.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;I Am Woman&quot;, Helen Reddy)

I&#039;m like you, man!  I&#039;m a guy!
This I no longer can deny,
For I&#039;ve sensed you know exactly what I am!
You&#039;ve suspected, and it&#039;s true,
That I&#039;m a fellow, just like you!
(Or you don&#039;t appreciate a sexy gam!)

Oh, yes, I&#039;m a male,
Though some body parts I lack!
Try to flirt, I fail!
(I need a bigger rack!)
Maybe I&#039;ve shown
Too much testosterone ...
I&#039;m a boy,
I&#039;ve got Y chromosomes,
I&#039;m like you, man!</description>

		<description>Geez. Whoever wrote that Violet&#039;s sense of self-identity is so weak that it&#039;s nonexistent, looks like they hit it right on the nose. Violet&#039;s almost certainly lying like hell, but at some point she&#039;s going to lose (or has lost already) her sense of who she is.

Good thing we have Tip, then.</description>

		<description>I think she&#039;s an avatar being run by Mr. Green.  I also think she&#039;s an idiot.  She may be a man, but she&#039;s &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; like Tip.
tune: &quot; I Am What I Am,&quot; Jerry Herman, &lt;i&gt;La Cage aux Folles&lt;/i&gt;, 1983

I am what I am
I am a man, despite this body
I think that you knew
Which is why you don&#039;t want this hottie
It&#039;s my plan, that I want to be with you in private
Though my little red Corvette: you will not drive it

I&#039;ll do what I must
Vic&#039;try or bust!
Trust me, I am what I am</description>

		<description>She has seemed very different in this storyline than from back when she negotiated the Skin Horse vs. the Machine Union situation.

I feel like that has to be a plot point.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;Cheeseburger In Paradise&quot;, Jimmy Buffet)

Locked in a cell, I&#039;m still schemin&#039; and plottin&#039;,
Looking for a way to attract
My psychologist victim, soon I&#039;ll have tricked him!
Got him where I want him, it&#039;s time to act!

Need a weapon to bring this man to his knees ...
Here&#039;s my favorite one:
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese,
Pickles, onions, all served on a sesame bun!

&#8195;&lt;i&gt;[CHORUS:]&lt;/i&gt;
&#8195;&#8195;These burgers attract the guys!
&#8195;&#8195;The way to their hearts is no surprise!
&#8195;&#8195;All that I need are just endless supplies,
&#8195;&#8195;Because ... these burgers attract the guys!

Plasteel walls do not a prison make,
Nor energy bars a cell!
Dreaming of Wilkin in underwear silken,
Got a plan to get the man under my spell!

There&#039;s many a way to a man&#039;s heart, they say,
But through is stomach is chief!
Gonna get in his pants, do the horizontal dance,
Clara Peller, gonna tell her, &quot;Here&#039;s the beef!&quot;
&#8195;&lt;i&gt;[repeat CHORUS]&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Detonation will end the operation of the unit, but I&#039;m not sure that even the St. Charlie residents would call that turning itself off.</description>

When did geek become the Arab honorific for &quot;Elder&quot;? I think that what you probably mean is &quot;Geek is Chic&quot;.</description>

		<description>Time for a montage of all the Sparks doing science while an upbeat, 80&#039;s pop song plays in the background.

It occured to me that since the portable fusion generators have names (Beni, Victor and Luigi) they might turn out to be sentients eligible for help from Skinhorse. Maybe the one that Mustachio used just wasn&#039;t in a talkative mood (or can&#039;t talk).</description>

		<description>Why do I get the feeling by the time these guys agree on the team logo, G.O.D.O.T. will have used Victor to turn the entire train inside out, upside down, and going through six extra dimensions that it wasn&#039;t really designed for?</description>

		<description>W/out written should be (theoretically) easy - TRACE the power cables - OPEN every breaker you find.  Keep going until you find the only thing powered (inside the last layers of breakers) and unplug it.

BTW - since most power plants (Oil, Gas, Nuclear) are self powering - you open enough breakers and they turn themselves off.  Admittedly not always safely, but when 

If it follows the same design as the SH model, is a pull module.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m becoming reminded of a scene in Terry Pratchett&#039;s &quot;Reaper Man&quot; where Ridcully the Brown when asked about wizards pointed out the Dean as typical of them in having a sense of urgency inferior to that of a paperclip. Our friend in the sun glasses would probably fit right in at Unseen University. ^_^</description>

		<description>A skin-horse t-shirt design competition revolving around nerditity: 

Geek is Sheik

My other T-shirt is too smart for you 
My Commodore 64 has 80 gigs of ram. 

You know how they have those t-shirts that look like tuxedos, how but one that has an iron-on of a pocket protector.</description>

		<description>&quot;Welcome to the third floor of Skinhorse: Finances, Human Resources, Cafeteria, and Lake of Raging Flames&quot;

Obviously the portable fusion reactor is in the wall safe for the same reason they keep the staplers there. Everyone kept &#039;borrowing&#039; the reactor without filling out the proper company resource usage forms, so the safe was the only logical place to put it.</description>

		<description>Oh, Ruby understands Mad Science(tm) well enough, She lives it by choice and is also a produce of it.

Mad Bureaucracy(tm) and/or Mad Government Agencies(tm) are a completely foreign concepts.

A Mad Scientist keeping a portable reactor/nuke in a wall safe that is &#039;safe&#039; enough that the receptionist can get access is par for the course ..... a Social Services Government Agency doing the same is something that Ruby never expected.

hehe ..... I wonder how Ruby would go if she was recruited into Skin Horse?</description>

We&#039;ve got ... this nuke device!
A type ... that we&#039;ve found twice!
When Ru-by asks us, &quot;Why?&quot;
Blank stare ... is our reply.

&#8195;&lt;i&gt;[CHORUS:]&lt;/i&gt;
&#8195;&#8195;Well, at least we don&#039;t have a lake of fire
&#8195;&#8195;Like the third floor has (&#039;cause they couldn&#039;t get it higher)!
&#8195;&#8195;But it&#039;s real-ly cool,
&#8195;&#8195;That lake of fire,
&#8195;&#8195;That lake of fire!

Why keep ... a nuke?  Don&#039;t know!
Far as ... ideas go,
It&#039;s not ... the best we&#039;ve had!
We can&#039;t ... call Ruby mad!

		<description>The correct answer should be &quot;Just in case we need it&quot;

Of course, a NORMAL Social Services agency would never have such a need.

I&#039;m thinking there will be a need for the SH pie in the future - beyond having M run amok.</description>

		<description>I know, right? 

Proof that grrls need to be at least a little plump to be their sexiest. (IMHO) Imagine Barbie doing that pose. It would look like someone missed the 10 pin on a 7-10 split! Bleaah!

Why is it that what is pleasing to the touch is considered not nearly as pleasing to the eye?</description>

		<description>Ed, I love the filk, but I believe that&#039;s Nick in the hat, not Chris.  Chris is much taller, and has long hair.  And are you sure about Dr. Lee?  It rather looks like she&#039;s locking eyes with Tigerlily.  I see definite three-way potential, or at least that&#039;s how I&#039;m shipping it.</description>

&lt;i&gt;[CHORUS:]&lt;/i&gt;
Can you pay?
Can you help in anyway?
Your display
Shows the cast at another of their dances!
If you pay
You will really make our day!
Kindly pay,
It&#039;s a way to assist with our finances!

See the cast, see them all,
See the elegant ball!
See the girl who was built,
See her gown, like a quilt!
Tip&#039;s swell,
Tigerlily as well!
They&#039;re a couple indeed!
But which of them will lead?

Chris is there, look at that!
He&#039;s not sure &#039;bout the hat ...
Marcie too, with a grin!
On her skirt, atoms spin!
We see
In the back, Doctor Lee,
As she&#039;s looking askance,
With Tip she wants to dance!

		<description>I think this is the most Girl Genius-esque strip ever to appear in Narbonic OR Skin Horse, and that counts the Foglio guest strips.</description>

		<description>Testing fireproofing is an easy one.  Maybe testing re-entry heat shields.  Baking cookies.  Firing home-made pottery.  Testing volcano crawling robots to infiltrate the lair of your archnemisis/enemy.  Exfoliating demons ( http://wapsisquare.com/comic/good-enough/ ).  Making smores.

And many other exotic and practical uses.</description>

		<description>Actually it&#039;s a shoebox sized portable reactor.
They replaced the water tank with something more compact, but it still isn&#039;t very stable.
Not that it matters to mad scientists.</description>

		<description>Annex One? A-sig (local/regional) HQ? Lee&#039;s home/apartment building?

My guess would be the second, although if Cypress got out on her own the first is plausible.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m not sure what type of experiments require a giant room full of roaring flames, but I really want to find out now (maybe forging a Ring of power).

Fusion pie sounds like a food item you woul find in a Fallout game. On that note, Unity would make a wonderfully zany ghoul.</description>

		<description>I still think shielding requirements would make them forklift portable at best.

Large water tank around the &#039;pie&#039; could do double duty as shielding as well as a secondary heat transfer medium.  24&quot; of water reduces gamma by 90%, and neutron by 99%.

I imagine the primary energy capture would be thermoelectric capture - bimetallic junctions to generate voltage differentials based on the temp the junction is at.</description>

		<description>Possibly some relation to &#039;Boz the Inimitable&#039;, AKA (the early) Charles Dickens? I don&#039;t know the &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; well enough to comment on the potential linkages.

Personally, I think he looks like a Riff, but that&#039;s probably due to the glasses.</description>

I am he, Duty Engineer!
Foolish words ... I don&#039;t hear!
I snub you,
With your I.Q.
Far from mine!

To-boz says, do not dare to think!
You are just ... a mere shrink!
Show respect!
Your intellect&#039;s
Far from mine!

&#8195;I control the engine that&#039;s the heart of all St. Charlie,
&#8195;And I scoff at all your worries and your fears!
&#8195;I ignore your pu-er-il-i-ty
&#8195;By humming with my fingers in my ears!
&#8195;&#8195;&lt;i&gt;(la la la ... la la la!)&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;Doody&quot; jokes, heard them all before ...
I have learned ... to ignore!
Please, just go!
Your minds are so
Far from mine!</description>

		<description>&lt;i&gt;Zardoz&lt;/i&gt; turned out to be a corruption of &lt;i&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt;.  Does Toboz have a similar source?  I can&#039;t find an Oz-character name that fits, but maybe I&#039;m missing something.  If we asked Unity, she&#039;d probably suggest &quot;The Butthead of Oz,&quot; but to me he looks like his name should really be Chip.</description>

		<description>The trick is you put it in buckets, and you put the buckets in a box that is it two places at once, with one of the places being the inside of the train. You then construct a robot arm to retrieve the buckets from the box and dump them into your magma system.</description>

		<description>Now, is Ruby&#039;s dialogue in the first panel edited by Shaenon for webcomics purposes, edited by U.N.I.T.Y.&#039;s brain (i.e., we&#039;re reading what she hears), or unedited?

I get a chuckle out of the thought that Ruby stopped to warn them and dumbed down the warning so our heroes would understand ^_^</description>

		<description>&quot;... or the shadows on the wall that look like text&quot; would probably extend to the brightness features on the lunar surface. There certainly wasn&#039;t any pre-existing writing on several of the walls he&#039;s used in St. Charlie, but there may well have been shadows. This requires an experiment: where&#039;s a arbitrarily flat surface and a battery of floodlights when you need one?</description>

		<description>Not to add any work for an overtaxed web-cartoonist, but that last panel would look really, really, cool in color and blown up to whatever size my computer wallpaper is (I expect you to know, because I&#039;m eating waffles and typing and don&#039;t have a hand free to work my mouse to check). If it ever comes to fruition, let me know. I live for the day when Skin-Horse is at least in my sunday paper and in color, might as well practice now.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover&quot;, Paul Simon)

Now Ruby warns us as we reach the engine room,
But it&#039;s gonna be some typical Mad Science, we assume ...
Then we look in ... it&#039;s like the center of Mount Doom!
There must be ... fifty feet of lovely lava!

It&#039;s like the games we used to play, not long before,
When we would say, &quot;OK, you die if you just barely touch the floor!&quot;
And now it&#039;s happened!  ... It&#039;s just a shame there isn&#039;t more!
There must be ... fifty feet of lovely lava!

&#8195;&#8195;We&#039;re feeling the heat, Pete!
&#8195;&#8195;It&#039;s more than just warm, Norm!
&#8195;&#8195;It&#039;s igneous rock, Jock!
&#8195;&#8195;Mad Scientists rule!

&#8195;&#8195;It&#039;s glow-y and red, Fred!
&#8195;&#8195;So just listen, what Ed said!
&#8195;&#8195;A spot that&#039;s so hot, Dot,
&#8195;&#8195;Is totally cool!</description>

Now - if this was a portal to somewhere else and this is tapping of a volcano somewhere, THAT is an entirely different kettle of brains.</description>

		<description>I hate it when that happens.  You start on a filibuster on the topic of conversation, you have both Facts and Truth on your side, and you get into the groove with a captive audience, and some niggling detail interrupts you mid-stride.  Some trivial nuance like an appointment, or the weather, or a zombie horde gnawing on your scalp.  (*sheesh*)</description>

		<description>Well, flubber body armor would cause the zombies to bounce off with slightly greater force than that used in their attack, so it would be most effective against fast zombies, and nearly useless for ones lying in wait. 
Now, a set of flubber body armor with weighted boots and surface wiring to provide electrical shock on contact would probably be quite effective for solo work. A slow zombie would recoil from the shock, and its forward momentum for a second attack would trigger the flubber effect, pushing the zombie away. The weighted boots are to make sure you have more mass than the zombie, to keep YOU from being the one pushed away. Perfectly obvious, if you&#039;ve watched enough Fred McMurray movies...</description>

		<description>Ah, one of the classic horror victims. The person who, despite warnings from the protagonists, manages to remain completely unaware of the impending danger. I guess being an absentminded professor type is only useful when inventing flubber, not fending off zombies hordes (though perhaps one could fend off zombie hordes with flubber).</description>

		<description>Regular bikes have a major advantage over recumbents in the real world: ability to actually see over cars.  If you only use them on deserted stretches of road, the various physical advantages of the recumbent come to the fore, but I prefer not navigating traffic blind.</description>

		<description>Something similar happens in the now-ended webcomic Mindmistress.  The heroine is a retarded woman who, due to a locket from her mother (it&#039;s complicated) can become hyperintelligent.  Mindmistress remembers all of the things that Lorelei does, but not the reverse.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m not sure who was more foolish in this one. Ruby for specifying he should get off his bike and run when he could have made a quicker getaway by pedaling as hard as he could, or Dr. Kirk for choosing to interpret &quot;stupid thing&quot; to mean &quot;impractical or useless device&quot; rather than &quot;silly looking machine&quot;, and then pontificate on the subject while a horde of zombies closed in upon him.

On second thoughts, it was clearly Dr. Kirk who was the most foolish.</description>

		<description>Interesting: so GODOT can really only change the text that is already there (or the shadows on the wall that &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like text) rather than create them out of nowhere.

		<description>Either one seems possible. If GODOT can affect the way a mind perceives the lettering on a sign, couldn&#039;t the same procedure change the way the mind perceives the international zombie symbol on a radar screen, by giving it cute little ears and a fluffy tail?</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; theme song, Chuck Lorre)

&lt;i&gt;[CHORUS:]&lt;/i&gt;
&#8195;&#8195;Snuggly fluffy kitten zombies!
&#8195;&#8195;Snuggly fluffy kitten zombies!
&#8195;&#8195;Snuggly fluffy kitten zombies!
&#8195;&#8195;Filling up the hallway ... Awesome still!

We&#039;re running as we try to save the day!
But a zombie horde is here to block the way!
Now we gotta save the train,
But the undead folks just want my brain!
&#8195;&#8195;&lt;i&gt;[repeat CHORUS]&lt;/i&gt;

My scanner says there&#039;s kittens up ahead!
Not fluffy, they&#039;re just hungry and undead!
Though I know the danger&#039;s great,
On a scale of ten, well, &quot;you&#039;re-an-eight&quot;!
&#8195;&#8195;&lt;i&gt;[repeat CHORUS]&lt;/i&gt;</description>

		<description>I foresee Ruby slapping herself in the forehead in the near future when she realizes what happened.

Depending on which hand she uses (the metal skeleton with organic skin and musculature, or the metallic polymer covering the bioware endo-structure) the marks will last for days.</description>

		<description>Instead of being remotely operated by a career soldier, possibly a dying (or drugged*) career soldier&#039;s consciousness was uploaded into Violet&#039;s mechanism.  Hence, no neural pathways anymore, but not an android.

Doubtless this will all make sense once we learn what Violet actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

		<description>Given what we&#039;ve seen of St Charlie (spontaneous kilt parties hosted by the security personnel, streetside mixed drink terminals, brain-o-mats,) Ruby&#039;s gullibility over the yogurt dispenser is a little more understandable.  Maybe she was in the &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; district.</description>

		<description>So, uh, the dimensional ratios of that slipcase don&#039;t happen to be 1:4:9, do they? Because the first thing I thought when I saw it was &quot;big gray monolith&quot;, and I&#039;m not sure how Skin Horse could be linked to 2001: A Space Odyssey but, dammit, monolith.</description>

		<description>Sili, is your copy of the book actually missing pages 97-120?  Because that would be really weird.  Shoot me an e-mail.</description>

		<description>They&#039;re gorgeous.

But is the lack of pages 97-120 intentional? I was looking forward to the seminaked mudwrestling, but if I&#039;m just missing a joke by it&#039;s being left out, please excuse me.</description>

		<description>Or how do you get Godot to want you inside the room? Godot does seem to have a dramatic side (hence all the monologuing to Tip), so maybe they should try loudly declaring:

&quot;Even though we&#039;ve been thoroughly trounced by Godot&#039;s pure genuis, at least it hasn&#039;t captured and imprisoned us inside the impenetrable room. It&#039;s just a robot after all.&quot;

Doesn&#039;t that always work?</description>

		<description>That&#039;s why everybody should learn to touch type.  It used to be that you did that so you could read the original while typing the copy on the MANUAL typewriter.  Now you should learn to do it so that you can type while the monitor&#039;s gone screwy.

		<description>Thats exactly WHY there would be a main to that section/room.

Damage control purposes in case of fire or mad-incident.

Properly - if its a lab There should be a &#039;kill switch&#039; just outside the protective area, as well as one INSIDE.  Much like the kill switches at a gas station - allows shutoff to the pump area in case of fire.

Machine shops have them for the more dangerous machines - so bystanders can shut down in case of an accident.

Elec labs have them for emergency de-energization in case of electric shock.

Being MAD does not require ignoring safety protocols after all.</description>

		<description>I figured the faked work order said to move GODOT into the room, probably when it was first built. Even if GODOT is immobile, the work order could have involved a latch on the door that clicked shut when the door was closed--which would mean that even GODOT can&#039;t open it.

But are we sure GODOT has no effectors? For all we know, it could have trundled in and shut the door, with the faked work order simply stating that the door should be propped open.

Insufficient information. Let&#039;s hope Ruby will be more forthcoming now.</description>

		<description>This is St. Charlie...what makes you think that it&#039;s safe to turn off the main? That also turns off the lights, the coolant pump and the electrically-powered momentum dampers for the labs...you know, to keep everything from blowing up every time the train speeds up, slows down or goes around a curve? That&#039;s what I meant by safe...
While a fire axe is a solution which might allow the wielder to survive, it is not always the best solution for the surrounding countryside...</description>

		<description>Fire axe handles are non-conductive on purpose.

When in doubt - take them ALL out.

Also applies to breaker boxes (home elec work) when in ANY doubt - turn off the main.</description>

		<description>My question is: How did GODOT become mobile enough to get into the room in the first place?
It seems to me that the real answer is that GODOT is in hiding outside, perhaps even having never moved at all, and has deceived everyone into believing it has penetrated the impenetrable room.</description>

		<description>The room is not truly impenetrable (typical mad scientist sloppiness) since electromagnetic radiation can get in and out. Probably also sound, unless GODOT is reading everyone&#039;s lips. So they can threaten to set up a fusion-powered sound system right outside the door, playing &#039;M is for the million things she gave me...&#039; at 200 decibels forever, unless GODOT plays nice. Though this doesn&#039;t work if GODOT plans to annihilate St. Charlie rather than just kill everyone.

Another thought: the room probably isn&#039;t designed to be permanently impenetrable, or it wouldn&#039;t have a door. If it&#039;s just a matter of proof of concept, an impenetrable shield would do as well as an impenetrable room. (Though who can predict what mads will do?) If it can&#039;t be opened from the outside (it&#039;s to shelter something rather than lock it in), there must be a way to open it from the inside. If that method is an electronic lock, see previous paragraph. If not, um, well....

OK, back to KeeCoyote&#039;s comment. Unleash Tip again! What have you got to lose?</description>

		<description>Sure. The techs probably put in a back door password, and wrote it down so they wouldn&#039;t forget it...and being clever, probably emailed it to themselves for backup. Nobody ever thinks to save passwords in an audio file...

		<description>This is St. Charlie. The coffeepot probably has a fusion reactor. GODOT undoubtedly has something more interesting, like a dark matter/dark antimatter conversion flow system, augmented by a little neutrino absorber, just in case it needs a jump start.
Does anyone else get spam from people wanting to patent perpetual motion machines? Or is it just me?</description>

And they said there was no market for audiobook versions of technical manuals...</description>

		<description>One shouldn&#039;t throw rocks at the messenger, no matter what the message or how satisfying it might feel at the time.  It just leads to lack of important messages later.
And didn&#039;t the techs responsible for making the door make a back-door password for maintenance?  Did anyone think to ask?  Or would that simply make too much sense?</description>

I don&#039;t suppose they&#039;ve tried cutting power/com lines?

Into the room where no one&#039;s gotten in before?
There are no windows, and there&#039;s just the single door
That now is closed and can&#039;t be opened anymore ...

It does no good to panic, run around, and shout!
You&#039;ve got to save us, that&#039;s what this is all about!

&#8195;We&#039;re off the rails!

&#8195;(Or maybe fifty-nine)
&#8195;It makes no diff,
&#8195;&#039;Cause here&#039;s the bottom line --
&#8195;The Bringer of Doom
&#8195;Is in that room!

How can we get in?

They did their best, but it was all to no avail!

		<description>What I find more amusing is that they had to write out the evil laughter instead of just providing stage instructions.  They probably tried to shorthand earlier, and she actually read out &quot;Evil laugh&quot; at the end of her statement.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s got to be more of GODOT&#039;s screwery; GODOT wouldn&#039;t let potentially important communication through in case it contains significant information. However, I bet it also happens to be the actual prepared statement.</description>

		<description>I was sure this was the case since Tip asked her to open the door, but there couldn&#039;t have been a better set-up to her finally admitting it.

And the fact that she ready the &quot;Nya ha ha ha ha.&quot; instead of laughing out loud just illustrates that she does, indeed, need to work on her scorn.</description>

		<description>That really works best when you&#039;ve got a Donovan McNabb-type scenario where the leader of one of the teams plays for the tie because he didn&#039;t realize there could be one.</description>

		<description>Good point. I&#039;m as inclined as you are to go with the former. The fact that she says &quot;they&quot; as though she&#039;s been told this multiple times would push the probability in that direction. It would also indicate she really is a Spark In Training or else they wouldn&#039;t care too much about whether she can do scorn or not and she wouldn&#039;t consider it plausible that they would care. I guess benign Mads are still Mads at base. ^^</description>

		<description>So the obvious question is: is that the actual prepared statement, or is it more of GODOT&#039;s screwery? I&#039;m inclined to lean towards a), but b)&#039;s a possibility.</description>

		<description>That was the impression I got, yes. Note that GODOT doesn&#039;t need pre-existing writing to create the illusion of a visual message, so if it could create the illusion of an auditory message, it wouldn&#039;t need to change a recording, it could just have words come out of the air. Instead, GODOT only speaks when a speaker is available, and the rest of the time communicates in writing.</description>

		<description>Looking it over, maybe GODOT just took over the speaker system and sent out its own messages rather than changing the existing recording.  Regardless, it seems like imitating a human being (or zombie or intelligent talking dog) would be hard to pull off, particularly since you&#039;d have to match up with the movements of the mouth.  Hmmm.</description>

		<description>Some of it is the military training - once a course of action is decided - clear confident deliberate behaviour.  When shifting gear (out of immediate casualty mode) things get wishy-washy.

He&#039;s just decided he has an hour and has stepped out for reinforcements and to have a tiny bit of a meltdown.  The facial expressions seem to imply he&#039;s not as confident in the shift between 3rd and 4th panels.</description>

Prior to the American Revolution, Europe&#039;s version were religious crusades both of the sectarian christian and &#039;liberate the holy land&#039; versions.

Then the trade/colonization wars of the 14th thru 18th centuries C.E.

Today - the middle east is trying to dig out of that same morass - Religious factions migrating/mutating into political/national/corporate factions.</description>

		<description>To the tune of &quot;Warning&quot; by Greenday

This is a confidential anouncement, no this is not a test
Professional misgivings put to rest
May require a breach in confidentiality
Caused by explosive threats to St. Charlie
Know I can&#039;t tell a lie, cause I am such a stand up guy
Approximately an hour, you&#039;re all gonna die.

Dying. You will be dying.
Said dying. You will be dying.
You all. Will die.

Couple of schedules and a teddy bear
Gonna blow this science train out of the air
Beware, my threats are rather unorthodox
The doc thinks I&#039;m credibly dangerous
Extermination, extirpation, go and kill everything
Or talk to Tip, cause he is listening.</description>

		<description>I found this while searching for something else.

http://skin-horse.com/2010/todays-comic-299/
July 3, 2010 from &quot;Brave Little Toasters&quot; as Violet is first meeting the Skin Horse team.

Violet: And you&#039;re U.N.I.T.Y.
Unity: Yep.
Violet: The Upgradeable Necrotic Independent ... what?
Unity: We don&#039;t talk about my acronym.
Violet: Sorry, did I touch a nerve?
Unity: Well, you know.  People died and stuff.

Kudos to Tetra Valent and Challeron for remembering.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s way too much time to give &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; Mad Genius free rein to respond, yes. But Mads have a hard enough time working together when there&#039;s no time pressure; distract them from the very deliberate socialisation that lets them do so, and they&#039;ll do an excellent job of disrupting each other such that nothing gets done.</description>

		<description>I think it would depend on the mad scientist&#039;s primary discipline.

If you went to a mad *fisher*, you&#039;d probably get something like the Po-Peel Artifact from Gurps IOU: not only does it catch the fish for you, it guts, scales, fillets, and cooks the fish to perfection from a menu of a million million possible fish dishes.  All of which are designed for ammonia-breathing life forms.</description>

		<description>It must be driving you and Jeff nuttier than it&#039;s driving the rest of us.  I guess this calls for:

&quot;Perseverance,&quot; by Edwin Carp

Somebody said it couldn&#039;t be done,
But he with a chuckle replied,
&quot;Maybe it couldn&#039;t, but I will be one,
Who&#039;ll never say &#039;No!&#039; &#039;til I&#039;ve tried.&quot;

So he buckled right in,
With a trace of a grin
On his face, if he worried he hid it.
And he tackled the thing that couldn&#039;t be done,

And he couldn&#039;t do it. 

(Carl Reiner, &quot;The Return of Edwin Carp,&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Dick Van Dyke Show&lt;/i&gt;, 1 April 1964.
Reiner wrote this parody of  Edgar Guest&#039;s &quot;It Couldn&#039;t Be Done&quot; for Richard Haydn to recite.)</description>

		<description>It&#039;s a server thing.  Dreamhost moved a bunch of sites to a new server that&#039;s having problems, and unfortunately this is one of those sites.  Supposedly it&#039;ll get straightened out.  In the meantime, there&#039;s nothing I can do about it on my end.</description>

		<description>Nice catch! Thanks, I&#039;d forgotten about Victor and Beni, and was assuming Victor was an engineer.

Though you&#039;d think anyone maintaining something that dangerous would know their job well enough to not need to consult instructions or to notice if menu options change. Then again, a new and unknown error message could probably send an experienced operator fumbling for the manual.</description>

For &lt;i&gt;Skin Horse&lt;/i&gt; pleasures I do thirst
But, lo, what greets me? It&#039;s the worst—
Internal Server Error

And on my iPhone I depend
It brings the world, my truest friend
(Look, we can&#039;t &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; have a wrench.)
But where&#039;s the comic? Gods forfend!

How do I post this? That&#039;s my quest
If you can read this, count me blessed
This website with my life has messed

		<description>Clearly, Moustachio and Gavotte were a thing, some time ago, but that&#039;s in the past, and trying to rekindle that spark would hurt both too deeply.  They both need to move on, find others to love.  Or so they think.

...My headcanon says both go after Tip at the same time, and through that rivalry, rediscover each other.  ^_~</description>

		<description>minor points of DU is expensive, birds don&#039;t slow down 30 mm du rounds, and the fact we were in-port with buildings and other ships across from us.

Since this was a US base overseas, I&#039;m sure the SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement) prohibited live fire in-port.

Incidentally - A-10&#039;s use similar 30 mm DU rounds in their anti-tank role. 

Both systems have fairly descriptive writeups on Wikipedia.</description>

		<description>At the risk of a grey-goo catastrophic failure, perhaps a healthy dose of nanomachines to keep everything in semi-working order?

If only we had a cell phone ringing in the last panel - that would imply that he was the only tech support person.  That would require more robust equipment - or there would be greater staffing required.</description>

		<description>I was still getting server errors trying to get to comment pages or earlier strips.  So I tried using a proxy. That worked so I figured my browser wasn&#039;t behaving. Had to change setting in Firefox plugin RefControl from &quot;block&quot; to &quot;forge&quot;.  So your server chokes if it doesn&#039;t see a (minimally) valid referrer header.</description>

Ingredients:
Sheep’s brains 4
Green chillies 1
Ghee 2 tbsp
Small piece ginger 1
 Onion 1 small
 Salt and pepper to taste
..
Cooking Directions.
1.  Clean the brains thoroughly and divide each into six. .

2.  Heat the ghee and fry the ginger in it.Grind the onion with 1 green chili, fry with the ginger..

3.  Next add the pieces of brain and seasoning..

4.  Allow to cook on a very low fire until the brains turn light brown.</description>

		<description>I was on a tour - it was in a &#039;test&#039; mode - unloaded.  Kept switching to tracking whichever moving bird was closest.  Its a loud chainsaw in that mode.  They showed us a film of it in actual operation as well (live fire mode).

Supposedly they had trouble testing it when it was under development - shredded the towed target, then started working up the cable toward the tow plane.</description>

Most people have many skills/abilities they choose not to use.  I can crochet for example (a dying ability) - but haven&#039;t used it productively since HS - except oddly - to teach granny-squares to an expectant mother among my coworkers....</description>

		<description>Mad Technical Support is practiced by those who have the genetic predisposition toward becoming a Mad Scientist, but were too lazy to study science in school. 

Also, OW. 

But at least they seem to have left the Hawaiian shirt intact, so good for them on that count.</description>

		<description>Shooting won&#039;t last long anyway.

Unless mad physics are involved (inside bigger than outside), or exotic ammo (AM2 in a xmperiumX pellet), budda budda usually means .50 or above for conventional munitions.  Even w/ exotics - single shots would be a &#039;crack&#039; sound as the round went supersonic.

FYI - DU slugs in a Phalanx cannon (fancy USN anti-missle system) fire so fast (multi rotating barrels) that it sounds more like a chainsaw mixed with explosions.  Those things are sensitive enough to track (and try to shoot down) seagulls.

Tech support is, by definiton, mad or on their way to mad.  Its the callers who make them that way.  As someone that people w/ questions get sent to in the office (BEFORE tech support), it is truly amazing some of the PBKAC issues out there.</description>

		<description>&quot;Budda budda&quot;? Is she really firing bullets at a steel door? Isn&#039;t she worried about ricochets--no, of course not. If she were she wouldn&#039;t be in St. Charlie.

Though I am worried that she&#039;s calling tech support. No proper mad scientist worth their salt would even consider the notion, and all the computer engineers I know are proof. (And yes, they&#039;re barking mad, all of them. What, sane computer engineers? Perish the thought!)</description>

		<description>I&#039;m not sure I understand. Is she saying that Ruby&#039;s response is not respectful, or is she trying to explain to Ruby that Tip&#039;s response, despite beginning &quot;with respect&quot; is not actually respectful? Or a little of both?</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, John Lennon)

Doctor Wilkin&#039;s making progress
As he&#039;s talking to GODOT ...
Find the source of his neurosis ...
But Sweetheart says they gotta go!
Hear Wilkin give his recommendation
What you can do with your regulations!
Crumple a stack that&#039;s ten feet tall
In a little ball ... and shove &#039;em all ...

&#8195;Where the sun ... don&#039;t ... shine!
&#8195;I don&#039;t care ... if we&#039;ve run ... past our time!
&#8195;Where the sun ... don&#039;t ... shine!

		<description>You do realize that Walske is a mad scientist, and not a historian, right? Either that, or he&#039;s been studying alternate dimension theory and forgot which one is his own timeline.
Seriously, I assumed the reference was to indicate being a thousand years behind the times, as opposed to the more common &quot;last century&quot; references used by the non-mad.
Besides, the 11th century really was a rather practical period, other than the occasional king wanting to ignore the laws of physics. Just because people don&#039;t know how the universe works doesn&#039;t make them stupid. Their evidence for trolls was just as convincing to them as our evidence for quarks and dark matter is to us. If you think that we&#039;re so much better informed, tell that to the people who produce all those &quot;finding Bigfoot&quot; shows on educational channels...</description>

Behold!  Manifesto has vanished!
It&#039;s gone, vanished into thin air!

You&#039;ll find ... you must open your mind!
Don&#039;t judge ... so impetuously!
You know ... that you shouldn&#039;t be using
That word ... that begins with a &quot;P&quot;!

&#8195;This is our creed!
&#8195;That anything goes!
&#8195;We&#039;re now realizing
&#8195;This skill of GODOT&#039;s!
&#8195;Words that didn&#039;t belong,
&#8195;They weren&#039;t there all along!
&#8195;What we&#039;re reading ain&#039;t right, and what&#039;s written is rotten and wrong!
&#8195;And we know
&#8195;If we don&#039;t stop GODOT
&#8195;Changing words that we&#039;ve viewed,
&#8195;We&#039;ll assume
&#8195;That we&#039;re facing our doom,
&#8195;And we&#039;re royally screwed!

And we know, what&#039;s been done in the past
Can&#039;t prevent what the future will see!
Just stop, if you catch yourself saying,
&quot;Oh, gee!  That can&#039;t possibly be!&quot;</description>

		<description>Either GODOT has a very convoluted plan that includes blowing the whistle on his texting capabilities, or there are limits on his texting capabilities; otherwise the menu would still be a manifesto.

Perhaps GODOT&#039;s wireless plan doesn&#039;t have unlimited texting?</description>

		<description>One nice thing about this is that Shaenon doesn&#039;t have to letter the strips.  She &quot;just&quot; draws them, including those &lt;b&gt;AWESOME&lt;/b&gt; backgrounds, and puts in word balloons.  GODOT handles the rest, making you think you&#039;re reading words in the strip.  I didn&#039;t even have to type this post, either - GODOT is showing it to you!</description>

		<description>Violet did tell GODOT she was going to take over the city, so the Chinese menu might actually be the fake words.

Does this mean that Skin Horse wins by default?</description>

		<description>Heck of it is, the &quot;manifesto&quot; is probably completely true, it just doesn&#039;t exist in the real world.  Might be safer for everybody if they let &quot;her&quot;, or &quot;they&quot; or whatever, remain in the pokey.</description>

		<description>Wait a minute. If GODOT really made the engineers perceive a Chinese takeout menu as an evil plan manifesto, why is it not using the same trick on Sweetheart and Unity right now?

Maybe it&#039;s letting them figure things out so as to mock them, or maybe it really is a manifesto of Violet&#039;s evil plan and GODOT is making them see a menu instead.</description>

		<description>That doesn&#039;t explain why the adjective &quot;fat&quot; is here.  Because it implies a whole bunch of things that are not apparently related to her creator&#039;s demise.

I expect you&#039;re right and this comment was probably meant to evoke the death of her creator, but it failed hard.  There are some venues in which I expect fat jokes and can be prepared, but getting sideswiped in a place where I never thought to shield myself against them is disappointing and even a bit heartbreaking.</description>

		<description>Hmm, I&#039;m reminded that around Boston &quot;potstickers&quot; are called &quot;Peking Ravoli.&quot; Which, umm, has nothing to do with anything beyond indicating that Violet (or GODOT, messing with everybody) isn&#039;t from Boston.</description>

		<description>Not at all.  Both are required for a properly balanced plate.  The crunchy texture of a well-made egg roll is as a shatteringly crisp yang to the potsticker&#039;s yielding yin.  

Violet must clearly be stopped.</description>

		<description>Buffalo Wild Wings Thai Curry sauce.

I&#039;m salivating just thinking about it.

They sell bottles at the take-out counter and I put it on quite a variety of things.  If it wasn&#039;t for the snow I think i&#039;d go have wings for dinner.</description>

		<description>Surely Godot recommended something better than steak sauce! Wouldn&#039;t coating oneself in beaten egg whites and then rolling in a mix of bread crumbs, parmesan, herbs and a little salt be more appropriate?</description>

		<description>...Okay, I&#039;m beginning to think my initial assessment of the Institute was grossly inaccurate. It seemed like they were just wanting to know what makes the mad scientists tick, possibly for Tinasky-related purposes. But now it looks more like they&#039;re into turning regular people into mad scientists, probably of the evil variety.</description>

		<description>Hey, one of the points for success; set your goals, and make sure you stick to them despite outside distractions.

Admittedly, hard to stick to in the face of zombies, but kudos to Sweetheart for keeping to the program.</description>

		<description>thats the fun part - no pressure of a linear story, so you get random developments or twists.  I never expected the &quot;my daddy is now a rabbit&quot; to last as long as it has for instance.</description>

		<description>Iunctio Quoniam Possimus...

Two verbs, it looks like; &quot;Iunctio&quot; would probably be &quot;I connect&quot; or &quot;I join&quot;, and &quot;Possimus&quot; is &quot;we can&quot;. I&#039;m guessing Iunctio is misconjugated; my first thought was that it should be in the infinitive form, but Google Translate tells me &quot;Quoniam&quot; is &quot;because&quot;, so maybe Iunctio should be pluralized? In any case, it appears to be evoking GLaDOS: &quot;We connect because we can&quot;.</description>

		<description>This must be where I lost track, when I was reading through as it updated; I remember Tigerlily&#039;s robot, and I think I remember the dress, but I definitely don&#039;t remember Tip&#039;s apartment.

Though I do remember Artie showing up later, so maybe I got back in for a bit without catching up.</description>

&emsp;Zombie apocalypse,<br />
&emsp;Zombie apocalypse &#8230;<br />

&emsp;&emsp;Though we are not sure what&#8217;s ha-appenin&#8217;&#8230;<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Running late, your points diminished!<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Even though we may be finished,<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Still, the rules we must adhere to<br />
&emsp;&emsp;As we&#8217;re drawing ever ne-ear to<br />

		<description>Random pick since I RSS many webcomics.

That image is from the comic &quot;Scenes from a multiverse&quot; http://amultiverse.com/

its a hard comic to describe - imagine a sequential far-side where the next part of a sequence may be weeks or months later.</description>

		<description>...You know, it occurs to me. These zombies are lurching for a cure to death.

They are knowingly and actively working toward their own obsolescence. It is their specific goal.

I wonder if that says things about the human condition or about the state of the undead mind.</description>

Mainbocher, Mainbocher, oh what a dress!
Looks good on Tip, I must confess!
Mainbocher, Mainbocher, looking so fine,
So Wilkin can deal with stress!

Mainbocher, Mainbocher, color of wine,
Made out of silk, lovely design!
Mainbocher, Mainbocher, gauntlets to match,
On Wilkin, it looks divine!

&#8195;The zom-bie, she wants some cocoa!
&#8195;And Doc Lee, she wants a brain!
&#8195;And &#039;Lily, boots that are go-go
&#8195;And ruling the world from Peru to Spain!

Mainbocher, Mainbocher, strapless and sleek,
Looking so good, looking so chic!
Mainbocher, Mainbocher, making me weak,
So ...
Wear it once more,
Pose for a sketch!
&lt;i&gt;Bravo, encore!&lt;/i&gt;
Elegant Tip
Will fill up a Sun-day strip!</description>

		<description>The post-integration and Ahvienda pillar-terrangreal stuff has me really curious.  Part of my re-reads is to look for stuff that was revealed in teh latest book, and try to spot any foreshadowing.  The tower of Gengi stuff really caught me off guard - even w/ the &#039;hints&#039; every other book.  The only absolute I knew about that was that M would be back.

The Potter books had SO many spoilers when you look back at them.  Even those i find new tidbits on every read.</description>

		<description>This is classic. The first panel and the last panel are just awesome. Where can we get a signed and framed copy suitable for wall hanging? I think my Christmas shopping has ended.</description>

		<description>Careful! It starts as one page... then you want to know what those other tropes are about... then suddenly you&#039;ve been indoors the whole Saturday and it&#039;s 5.30 am in the morning and you have over 400 open tabs... 
And the worst thing is, I&#039;m not really exaggerating, that&#039;s when I made the final switch from Firefox: I still have almost 500 tvtropes tabs in there. So beware.</description>

		<description>Yeah. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very offensive at all, and I doubt I may survive very long in one of those. Hell, I don&#039;t think I will survive once KFC finally opens for business down here.</description>

		<description>I just spent a couple of hours giggling over the TV Tropes pages on Skin-Horse and Narbonic.

An awesome way to spend an afternoon.  I have it bookmarked now so i can amuse myself on other topics.  HOW have I been online for the last 20 years and never been to this site before??</description>

		<description>Second the applause for Sweetheart&#039;s final expression.
What I want to know, though, is how Sweetheart got from I SEE YOU DOG to &#039;someone is messing with Every! Thing! You! Read!&#039; There&#039;s lots of other evidence, of course, but we ain&#039;t seen her saw it. It&#039;s not an unreasonable hypothesis on a trainful of mad scientists, but it&#039;s not one that leaps to mind either.
Also, I&#039;m only borderline obese, but I don&#039;t see Sweetheart&#039;s remark as so terribly lipophobic.</description>

		<description>having seen some of the random stuff out there on twitter - even when you expand the conversation it is gibberish.

The most coherent twitter-stuff I have seen have actually been webcomic related.  Othar (character in Girl Genius) had a feed - running narrative that was an ok storyline (currently inactive).  

Simliarly Questionable Content has twitter feeds for several of the characters, and the feeds interact, much like they would/do in teh comic.  I&#039;m still trying to figure out the best way to read those together to see what story/plot is imbedded.

Now for heavier reading - i&#039;m re-reading WOT (last book due in Jan 2013) and having to keep notes (again) to figure out who is not dead anymore and who is betraying whom.  Makes LOTR look like &quot;see spot run&quot; for complexity.</description>

		<description>They&#039;re generally a last resort, but there are some things that can&#039;t really be explained to the minions doing the heavy/dangerous work without reference to physical media. After all, it would be beneath the dignity of any self-respecting Mad to do such things personally. And while the Igor and Misanthropie lines are renowned for their anticipation, the more economical minion is not quite as user-friendly.</description>

		<description>It would be interesting if you used an adaptive AI and had the player have to survive against the AI. At first it just messes with you and you can follow instructions to get around it...then it changes the instructions...then it tries changing it in other ways to try to trick you into doing the wrong thing some other way....

The difficult thing would be making sure it was actually playable without being nintendo-hard and entirely trial-and-mostly-error.</description>

		<description>So G.O.D.O.T. can anagram in different languages.  And we&#039;ve seen him(?) draw arrows in other comics.  Aside from the zombie apocalypse (pending), what happens when he actually starts altering blueprints and design specs from some of the madder residents of St. Charlie, or even the latin names on some of the medications being created/for the mad medical doctors and pharmacists?  Given the trains habit of appearing, well, anywhere, this could be a bigger armageddon than anyone dreamt of.</description>

		<description>While it takes an app on Android to get the dogs to kill on command, Siri will probably do it at will on the iPhone 5. Not saying either is better, just saying both take different routes to kill you.

Why, yes, I&#039;m drunk on egg nog. Drank the whole glass container! (So wish I never discovered I&#039;m in walking distance to Whole Foods.)</description>

		<description>So. Goldbug is Pinocchio, I&#039;m guessing. (Daughter, wants to be human, lies?) The house is St. Charlie, perhaps? (???) It is certainly underwater (a la The Terrible Dogfish) and will soon be dead, or so it thinks. There would presumably also be tie-ins to one of the androids-as-Pinocchio works.

Not sure these speculations are making any sense. Still fun to make them.</description>

		<description>The lunar program was also done back when the entire world used imperial units.

The problem w/ one of the mars landers was somebody confused Meters and Yards - a strike against the imperial system in my eyes.

I did however specify that the CHEMISTRY was metric.

I&#039;ve worked nuclear power and steam power plants.  Solid chemicals are mxed in grams per liter for waterchem purposes.</description>

		<description>Milspeak DOES use metric - just usually a the techie end of things.

Anything touching chemistry deals w/ metric, probably because you can&#039;t find the graduated equipment set up in tablespoons, and fluid ounces are too large to be useful.

That and the HS and Colleges teach chem using metric - too much trouble to retrain.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;The Way We Were&quot;, Barbara Streisand)

Mem&#039;ries ...
What the Futurist had seen ...
Round and round, the colored memories
Of the One Old War ...

Had a house built ...
Daughter, happy and serene!
Dogs and rabbits, cats and secrets
Of the One Old War ...

&#8195;In that house is found the final memory ...
&#8195;I have heard that soon they both will die!
&#8195;All of that was long before my time, you see ...
&#8195;Sad to say, guy ...
&#8195;No lie!

Mem&#039;ries ...
Very soon, none will remain!
I won&#039;t tell you where the house is
&#039;Cause you&#039;re stuck aboard this train!
So sorry, Charlie!
Misfortune just befell you!
There&#039;s nothing I can tell you ...
&#039;Bout the One Old War!</description>

		<description>One of the old native american myths, possibly a mesoamerican myth, had something about humanity&#039;s tools rising up against humanity - even domesticated animals.

If it wasn&#039;t for the way a day takes forever in the strip - I&#039;d think this was a 2012 arc - much like there was a after-Y2K comic (still may run for all I know).  

Time to delve into the google-vaults - maybe bookmark some comic archives for the long holiday weekend.</description>

		<description>Some sort of &#039;creator vs. created&#039; war, that for some reason the bulk of people don&#039;t know about, but the &#039;created&#039; underground does, with Skin Horse having been created to keep things from going out of control and it happening again, by helping the &#039;created&#039; feel like they were &#039;real,&#039; while the society at large still considered them &#039;other&#039;.

The underground, of course, knows how they&#039;re viewed by the folks at large, and don&#039;t like it, remembering the war.</description>

&quot;Don&#039;t let her provoke a fight. It ain&#039;t the Old War no more.&quot;

I also thought Gavotte may have referenced the Old War at some point when the team was away, but I may be just be confusing it for another vague clue that she knows more than she tells them (and discusses it with Moustachio over tea).</description>

I believe there&#039;s another reference in &quot;Come Swing From My Branches&quot;, but I don&#039;t have the time to hunt it down at the moment.</description>

		<description>This is the first strip in which GODOT has emphasized individual letters.  The AI has put whole words in a larger font, but that has always seemed to be for normal vocal emphasis.  I haven&#039;t found a deeper pattern in the highlighted words yet, but I&#039;m sure this stuff is all deliberate.</description>

		<description>Does anybody know of a way to prevent it from working on people who are merely on the side of annoying?
I mean, there I am, reading a BOOK (ink on paper, yes) and people feel the irresistible urge to tell me their life stories.  I DON&#039;T GIVE A ****!!  GO AWAY!!</description>

		<description>When you are devoted to your craft -- and if you are not obsessive, you may not be cut out for this kind of work -- it can be hard to meet people other than the ones you meet professionally. Just remember to chat and THEN kill, because the reverse doesn&#039;t work, except for necromancers. Watch out for those guys.</description>

		<description>Thats an awesome podcast - most of the Howstuffworks.com family of podcasts is pretty good.  Downside is i have to cherrypick what to listen to because i can never keep up w/ all of it.

I would also recommend you try History According to Bob, and Dan Carlin&#039;s Hardcore History.

Professor Bob (Really!) usually has about 3-4 lines of podcasts going at once on different themes, 15 min max each episode.

Carlin is irregular, approx monthly, and depending on the topic, runs 40 min to 4 hours - last release was part 3 of 4 on the Mongols, and that segment ran about 90 min.</description>

		<description>I have a similar story!  A friend of mine from high school in Phoenix drove her car in to a dealership service bay.  Got out and announced that her pet was lost in the car and $50 to the guy who gets it out.  Several guys pile in to the car.  Then one gets the bright idea of asking what they were looking for.  She replies that it&#039;s a 6&#039; boa constrictor.  Several guys pile out of the car.

The solution was easy: start the car and crank up the air conditioning.  It was hiding in a vent and came right out.</description>

		<description>So last night my wife and I are driving back from the observatory, she had to install and test a software patch for her laser system where she bounces it off the moon, and as we are frequently wont to do I queued up a podcast of Stuff You Missed In History Class.  As it happens, the latest ep is &quot;The True Story of the Chevalier d&#039;Eon: Part 1&quot;, who apparently is considered the patron saint of transvestites and cross-dressers and also had an illustrious military career.  The description was &quot;Recently, London&#039;s National Portrait Gallery acquired a portrait of the Chevalier d&#039;Eon, the first oil painting in its collection to feature a man in women&#039;s clothing. Learn how Louis XV&#039;s underground foreign policy led d&#039;Eon to acquire a female identity.&quot;

Coincidence?  I think not.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;Yer So Bad&quot;, Tom Petty)

Though cobras are growing,
Blood flow is slowing ...
Feels like we&#039;re catching a cold!
We don&#039;t want no germ, ick!
We&#039;re ectothermic!
Pardon if we&#039;re a bit bold ...

&#8195;Oh, may ...we ... hug ... you?
&#8195;We don&#039;t want ... to ... bug ... you,

&#8195;&#8195;But you&#039;re so warm!
&#8195;&#8195;Wrapped in a cobra swarm!
&#8195;&#8195;We will hug your form!
&#8195;&#8195;You&#039;re so warm!

Here&#039;s Miss Tigerlily!
Builds stuff that&#039;s kill-y!
Dressed like a babe from downtown!
She&#039;s got self-reliance,
Pants made of science!
Won&#039;t let the Man keep her down!

&#8195;She has ... no ... co-bra,
&#8195;Though she&#039;s wear-ing ... no ... bra!

&#8195;&#8195;But she&#039;s so hot!
&#8195;&#8195;Look at the tools she&#039;s got!
&#8195;&#8195;She gets drawn a lot!
&#8195;&#8195;She&#039;s so hot!</description>

		<description>Every time I see the Huggy Cobras I&#039;m reminded of a story.

There was an &quot;exotic dancer&quot; (No! Not a stripper!  She started w/o clothes;) and her &quot;partner&quot; was an eight foot long boa constrictor.  On night, or early morning as the case may be, she was taken into an ally at knifepoint.  Her assailant ordered her to strip.  As she was undoing her coat the snake poked it&#039;s head out, curious as to what was going on.  The police were called and in addition to the charge of assault with a deadly weapon they added disturbing the peace because he wouldn&#039;t stop screaming.</description>

		<description>To the poster called Andrew,
I will simply say “Me too.”
Now I&#039;m wiser reading filks by Ed.
As you pour a drink I shake my head,
‘Til at last you learn, you must first set down your glass,
Or go &quot;splash&quot;!
That frightful sound …
Is whiskey!</description>

		<description>Unity has much to learn about the art of doing nothing, whereas Tip provides an excellent example of proper inaction technique by bringing a chair. After all, soreness from sitting on the floor may break one&#039;s concentration on their endeavour to avoid endeavours.</description>

		<description>You just described a good sargeant, too. Always make those under you think all bad decisions come from above and all good ones from you. Always make those above you think your ideas are thier ideas. It&#039;s a fine line to walk but the good ones do it without even thinking.</description>

		<description>Anyone who&#039;s read &lt;i&gt;Catch-22&lt;/i&gt; knows captains (or O3 equivalents), because of where they are in the chain of command, are experts in manipulating both higher- and lower-ranked officers into doing exactly what they want through subtle manipulation and use of situational psychology.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;Earth Angel&quot;, The Penguins)

Right angle, right angle,
Good use of space!
I&#039;ll make it neat,
Put stuff in its place!
It&#039;s just a rule,
A rule I think is great ...

Right angle, right angle,
That I adore!
Tip knows I&#039;ll go
On the count of four!
I think it&#039;s cool,
It&#039;s cool to make thing straight!

&#8195;When things align,
&#8195;Then I feel fine!
&#8195;I&#039;m just as happy as can be!
&#8195;When they&#039;re oblique,
&#8195;It makes me shriek!
&#8195;It aggravates my O.C.D.!
&#8195;&#8195;&lt;i&gt;(eee-eee-eee ...)&lt;/i&gt;

Right angle, right angle!
I heed your call!
Ninety degrees,
You&#039;re orthogonal!
I&#039;m just a fool,
A fool who thinks you&#039;re great!</description>

		<description>tune: &quot;I&#039;m gonna sit right down and write myself a letter,&quot; Fred E. Ahlert &amp; Joe Young, 1935, first recorded by Fats Waller
Shaenon, I put in an Oxford comma, just for you (she said with a shudder).

I plan on sitting in this chair and doing nothin&#039;

		<description>I do kind of want to know what &quot;hat-hangings&quot; replaced.

Also, who programmed the censor. It seems somewhat context-sensitive.</description>

		<description>There&#039;s always the risk of snark backlash. He knew what he was getting into. Besides, I bet zombies have a better union than IT guys, so it may come out better in the end for him.</description>

There&#039;s nothin&#039;, man!
There&#039;s nothin&#039;, man!
I tell you that there&#039;s nothin&#039;, man!
I&#039;ve got the only brain!

I know that things are tough, an&#039; man,
They&#039;re rough, an&#039; man,
I&#039;m gruff, an&#039; man,
No brains with pumpkin stuffin&#039;, man!
I&#039;ve got the only brain!

Machine is down, the screen is dark!
At you I bark,
But then I hark,
I just should not have said, with snark,
I&#039;ve got the only brain!

The zombies&#039; hunger is unbound!
An eerie sound
Will now surround!
There&#039;s not enough to go around!
I&#039;ve got the only brain!</description>

		<description>RTFM is essential for certain equipment.  Keeping the reactor from going foom in a bad way until you WANT it to go foom (such as the self destruct sequence.

Additionally some mad equipment is designed to be mad-proof, how else to have any equipment to rebuild the lab after the last FOOM.

Reactors must be critical/SLIGHTLY supercritical  to produce power - subcritical reactors are expensive paperweights.

A properly trained brain-dead zombie (awake for a day and a half) can properly respond to a power plant casualty (immediate actions to support the on-watch shift) before completely waking up.</description>

		<description>&quot;Now, you wanted the dark meat . . . , and you wanted the light meat . . . , and who got the arm?&quot;

Killer tomatoes or killer zombies, when the line works, the line works.

I doubt U.N.I.T.Y. will be able to dissuade them with ketchup, though.</description>

		<description>Clearly GODOT planned ahead better than I had thought.  Perhaps he placed the Tech Support request himself, to make sure the Tech Guy arrived on schedule.

I like Anderson&#039;s solution, though I expect glass-substitute to be a bit tougher than codebracker&#039;s glass, as the designers of the Brain-o-Mat (perhaps Casey and Andy, by the name^_^) will have found the first time that it broke down that ordinary glass is too fragile to last until the Tech Guy gets there.</description>

		<description>(TUNE: &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, Don Henley)

I&#039;m on St. Charlie, it&#039;s the train of trains!
Lurching down the hallway in my mortal remains!
Do I have a need for brains?
I do data entry!

I&#039;m a-tappin&#039; on the keypad all the live-long day,
Putting in the numbers in an accurate way ...
That is how I earn my pay!
I do data entry!

&#8195;&#8195;Listen to me sob
&#8195;&#8195;At the Brain-O-Mat!
&#8195;&#8195;Can I do my job?
&#8195;&#8195;(Please don&#039;t answer that)
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&lt;i&gt;(x2)&lt;/i&gt;

Hear the technician as he tells the room
Normal operation will now shortly resume ...
Then we hear a big ka-BOOM!
What of data entry?

There&#039;s panic spreading up and down the hall!
Will the tech guy charge us for a service call?
Do I need a brain at all
To do data entry?

&#8195;&#8195;Can I ascertain
&#8195;&#8195;How to hit the keys,
&#8195;&#8195;All without a brain?
&#8195;&#8195;(Do not answer, please)
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&lt;i&gt;(x2)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

		<description>Whoops...this is the Therac-25 all over again.

There&#039;s still an easy solution to all this....just get Unity in. If she can accidentally break through 20ft of reinforced concrete then the tanks shouldn&#039;t be too tricky.</description>

		<description>I think GODOT may be overplaying his hand a bit.  All it would take is one zombie who is not quite brainy enough to read but still knows to put coins in and push a button, and this part of his scheme is not only over, but more zombies will know his font.

No battle plan survives contact with the undead hordes.</description>

		<description>I suppose more sulci would probably mean a more tender brain and a finer dining experience. More brain for your buck. Thanks for the answer.</description>

		<description>Allright, I can&#039;t for the life of me figure out what crenellations would be in a biology context (unless of course they&#039;re using a zombie definition of the word that is unknown to us pre-mortem mortals). As interesting as the idea of a brain with medieval fortifications is, I am wondering if anyone knows what Bob is talking about?

Perhaps it will be up to Unity to give a rousing speech that will help the zombies overcome their hunger for brains and stop them from devouring the populace? Or she could just join them... Yeah, probably that.</description>

		<description>I may not get many ideas for filks, but this strip practically begged for this song - and didn&#039;t even need much modification, in many places!

Tune: &quot;The Wall&quot;, Pink Floyd; parts 1-3 combined

GODOT&#039;s gone and crossed the line now,
Playing with our memory.
Signs to make us meet our maker,
GODOT, what else did you make us see?
GODOT, what else did you make us see?
All in all it was just a word on the wall.
All in all it was all just words on the wall.

---

I don&#039;t need no ammunition,
I just use my thought control.
No Brainomat to tame the zombies,
Lurching now for brains alone.
Saint Charlie! Lurch for brains alone!
All in all it&#039;s just another word on the wall.
All in all you&#039;re just another word on the wall.

[Undead chorus]

Lurching now for brains alone.
Saint Charlie! Lurch for brains alone!
All in all it&#039;s just another word on the wall.
All in all you&#039;re just another word on the wall.
[/undead chorus]

---
&quot;Words bend to my will. I&#039;ll mislabel every button. Corrupt every monitor.&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m your failure. the UNITY project. The one acronym you couldn&#039;t finish&quot;
&quot;I do not have mental problems. I merely wish to wipe out a train city because I am bad at acronyms&quot;

I don&#039;t need no arms to hurt you,
I don&#039;t need no drugs to harm you,
I have been the writing on the wall.
Only words and you will do it all.
Yes! All I need to make you do it all.

		<description>At some point, the designers of the BrainOmat had this conversation:
&quot;So, say something goes wrong with the dispensers and you&#039;ve got a huge crowd of brain-ravenous zombies outside getting angry and irrational. What&#039;s the worst that could happen?&quot;
&quot;They might break in and take the brains without paying. So we use some kind of unbreakable super-glass. Problem solved, everyone happy, right?&quot;</description>

		<description>say one word in German?

hmmm ..... I wonder .....

perhaps the answer/trigger phrase is to say &quot;one word&quot; in German? (thank you Tolken :-)

so, that would be (according to google translate), that would be &quot;ein Wort&quot;, yes?</description>

		<description>I&#039;m cross reading the Sparks of Girl Genius.  They DO use control groups.  In one recorded instance, a spark who studied behaviour in children used to let the children out of their cages for xmas.

EXCEPT of course, the control group.</description>

		<description>Speaking of language apps, there&#039;s a Kickstarter underway for a contemporary magic RPG set in Korea called Magicians. at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1858774754/magicians-a-language-learning-rpg/, it closes in six days and is fully funded.  The part that ties this in to language apps is that the mechanic for casting magic is to speak Korean in to a smart phone dictation app, and if you say it correctly, the spell works.  Start with a small vocabulary and a small amount of magic that you can do and your power set becomes larger as your skill and vocabulary improves.

They&#039;re doing expansions to learn Chinese and Japanese as already-funded stretch goals.

I&#039;m just shilling for them, I&#039;m not part of the development group.  I think it&#039;s a pretty awesome idea.</description>

		<description>In panel four, that is the derpiest dog I&#039;ve ever seen that isn&#039;t a Boston terrier. Nothing against Boston terriers, mind you. It&#039;s just that the pop-eyed thing makes them look dumber than they are.</description>

		<description>I sincerely doubt there *are* any normal, non-GE dogs in St. Charlie, but I do think this is the first time she&#039;s seen any of normal intelligence in the comic proper.

The filename story treats her time in the shelter, an experience she describes as &quot;mindnumbing.&quot;</description>

		<description>Non GM in a city of Maddies?  Must have been the control group.

Also - looks like a collie/shelty and whatever Orphan Annie&#039;s dog was (or maybe it was Tin-Tin&#039;s dog - i haven&#039;t read those since elementary school).  The stereotype for german guard dogs is Doberman/Shepard/Rottwieller, w/ a dachshund thrown in for comic relief.</description>

		<description>Stunning artwork as usual.  Today is a bit of a tease tho - I had asked for a Marcie sketch, so the first one has me wondering.... (the hawaiian one was ruled out by the commentary).

WAY looking forward to the arrival.  Even started saving custom framing flyers from the local craft store.</description>

		<description>I agree with Shaenon, because I am so in love with Nick.  He&#039;s Gatsby and Heathcliff and Lancelot and Rick in &lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt; all in one, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; he&#039;s Jewish.  And sweary.  My hero.  Sigh.

		<description>I started it yesterday just before I had to leave the house.  Finished it up this morning.  I like how it has non-comic stuff mixed in w/ references to the events of the comic.

I DO think that the reason it is erratic is because it is ##@$@ impossible to post at a rate/in synch w/ a comic where a single day may take place over 2 weeks of strips.

I still think that a character commentary like that would add an interesting twist to the books.</description>

		<description>I hadn&#039;t known about Nick&#039;s LJ until it was mentioned here a day or two ago.  So now I&#039;m going through it chronologically, comparing it to the Skin Horse archives.  I&#039;ve got other stuff I should be doing....  Curse you Shaenon and Jeff!  :)

It&#039;s odd that Unity only started her log in the LJ a month after the New Orleans mission had ended.</description>

		<description>It helps that i&#039;m A) Ex-Navy, and B) a defence industry worker.  

The history books always speak of the fleets of ships and such - nobody remembers that it can take up to 20 years to design and build a new class of ships, be they warships or cargo.

Highways and Railroads are also examples of infrastructure that everyone takes for granted, but only really notices when they are not available.</description>

		<description>Robert the Addled is right. I work for a public library, and a lot of the work that we do isn&#039;t immediately obvious to the public, but consists of things necessary for when the public wants that next best seller, or information on their stock investments, or that storytime to bring their kids to. Government agencies spend a lot of time and energy on what amounts to an infrastructure.
Now, in the case of Skin Horse, that infrastructure is to create the methodologies for dealing with the results of mad science experiments, so our jobs do differ a little bit there. Most of our local mad scientists clean up after themselves, as required by California law.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t know what happened, but when I tried to use the Firefox/RSS reader add on that I&#039;ve been using, your feed vomited up over 190 or so of your past strips. I&#039;m using Firefox version 16.0.2 and something called &quot;RSS Ticker&quot; version 12. I just checked off an option limiting each feed to 5 items, so that shouldn&#039;t happen again. I hope. :-/</description>

		<description>To a degree, that is what is desired in govt.

Milling about semi-productive when times are good, but big enough that when the excrement hits the rotary impeller they are ready and able (and suitibly sized) to deal with the crisis.

I think of the Korean war - everything had been downsized SO MUCH after WWII that much had to be built/developed from scratch to support the Asian theatre (since the cold war was ongoing in Europe already).

Or like a firehouse - you WANT them there drilling in place - ready to go.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m only just past the Nuclear Pie issue - I think it&#039;d be HILARIOUS if at some point there were annotated versions of the books - w/ date/comic approprite blending of social media commentary from our beloved characters.</description>

		<description>I think part of my brain is still on daylight time ... it wasn&#039;t until I finished this that I realized, &quot;Counter-productive, ineffective&quot; would scan to the Beastie Boys&#039; &quot;Intergalactic Planetary&quot;.  Well, I wasn&#039;t about to do the whole thing over (plus I like this song better).

(TUNE: &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;, Milton Ager and Jack Yellen)

Sweetheart, Tip, and Unity ...
Now our incompetence, you&#039;ll see,
Beats their counter-productivity!
Who is ineffective?  We!

Since we found this crazy joint,
We haven&#039;t won a single point!
But our team as winners you&#039;ll anoint
Though we do not have one point!

&#8195;So hear our motto in song!
&#8195;(Although it seems a bit long ...)

So let&#039;s start another day
Of pointless talking and delay,
With the zombie chanting, &quot;USA!&quot;
So let&#039;s shout &quot;hooray&quot; today!</description>
