													All was good until I met the “beast.”

The beast tricks you with the promise of great things and lures you with false promises into a binding agreement.

This beast does not die, it does not sleep, it feeds! Feeds from the blood of innocent developers only to return scraps. (That is if you are lucky enough to get the scraps)

This hell spawn profit sucking beast of a publisher refuses to die even when they don’t have any real assets other than the name of the beast.

You might think I am talking about big publishers like EA or Activision but no, this								]]>

				<![CDATA[
													I was hired on as a software engineering intern at a company in LA. Early on, one of my coworkers urged me to never fix the printer less I become &#8220;The guy who knows how to fix the printer.&#8221;

Lord I wish I knew what he meant.

I was assigned to a team project, and, thanks to a background in IT, I turned out to be really good at fixing builds and determining whether a bug was legitimate or if it was some failure of the vm or machine.

Honestly, 90% of the time, you just had to rerun the build script to								]]>

													My tale isn&#8217;t so much &#8220;from the trenches&#8221; as much as it is about how close I became to being deep inside the foxhole.

It was November, 2004 and my graduation from undergrad was rapidly approaching. I had already received a job offer I was seriously considering, but before I could accept that offer, EA contacted me and said they&#8217;d like to interview me. &#8220;Great,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;it&#8217;s every developers dream! Working for a game studio!&#8221; We set a date and time for a phone interview and I began eagerly counting down the days, until&#8230;

...remember, this was November of 2004. For								]]>

				<![CDATA[
													The tales from the trenches are tales of woe.&nbsp; Constant refrains of &#8220;The hours are long.&nbsp; The pay sucks.&nbsp; Everyone misunderstands that we do much more than get &#8216;paid to play games all day.&#8217;&#8221;

This is all true.

But I&#8217;ve never been happier.

Being a game tester is almost exactly like being a waiter/waitress in LA.&nbsp; Most of us dream of something bigger, better.&nbsp; This is what you do, until you can prove you can do better.&nbsp; And I knew it was going to be terrible. I did my homework&#8212;I read the horror stories&#8212;I thought I knew what to expect. But what I								]]>

													I was once hired to do QA for a big company in the industry. It was a temporary position, contracted for 6 months, but had potential for upwards movement.

That was 3 years ago.

I&#8217;m still temporary. I was laid off once, only to be re-hired a week later with a new contract. I&#8217;m pretty sure that what this company is doing by keeping me temporary is illegal, but I don&#8217;t want to say anything because I don&#8217;t have another job lined up.

I scour the internet everyday for a new job.								]]>
