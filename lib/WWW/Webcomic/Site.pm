=over

=item home_page

A WWW::Webcomic::Page object for the main page. If you supply a string
instead, a new WWW::Webcomic::Page object will be generated from that
string.

=cut

has 'home_page' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'WWW::Webcomic::Page',
    coerce   => 1,
    required => 1,
);

=item feed_pages

An arrayref of RSS or Atom feed pages served by this site. WWW::Webcomic::Page
objects - so not parsed or anything.

=cut

has 'feed_pages' => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'ArrayRef[WWW::Webcomic::Page::Feed]',
    lazy    => 1,
    builder => 'fetch_feed_pages',
);

# home_page is ro and required, so we know it exists at this point.

    my ($self) = @_;

    # Find whether we have any RSS or Atom feeds linked from the home page.
    # If there's nothing there, fine.
    my $homepage_contents = $self->home_page->contents;
    my @feed_urls = Feed::Find->find_in_html(\$homepage_contents,
        $self->home_page->url);
    return [] if !@feed_urls;

    # Right, fetch the feeds. Get them via our Feed module (a) so we can
    # cache this stuff, and (b) so we can override the default user-agent.    
    # webcomicsnation.com and possibly others decide to brush you off
    # if you use the default libwww/perl user agent.
    my @feeds;
    for my $feed_url (@feed_urls) {
        my $feed_page = WWW::Webcomic::Page::Feed->new(url => $feed_url);
