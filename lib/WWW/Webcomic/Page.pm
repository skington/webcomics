=head1 NAME

WWW::Webcomic::Page - a webcomic page object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $page = WWW::Webcomic::Page->new(url => 'http://xkcd.com/');
 my $contents = $page->contents;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Moose class that represents a webcomic page.

=head2 Attributes

=over

=item url

The URL of the page. Specify either a string or a URI object. Stored
internally as a URI object.

=cut

has 'url' => (
    is            => 'ro',
    isa           => 'URI',
    coerce        => 1,
    lazy_required => 1,
);

=item user_agent

The user-agent used to fetch pages. By default a standard LWP::UserAgent
object with a custom agent string to avoid some websites blocking
vanilla LWP.

=cut

has 'user_agent' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'LWP::UserAgent',
    builder => 'build_user_agent',
);

sub build_user_agent {
    my ($self) = @_;

    my $user_agent = LWP::UserAgent->new;
    $user_agent->agent($self->agent_string);
    return $user_agent;
}

sub agent_string {
    'Webcomics parser/' . $VERSION;
}

=item cache_directory

Optional; a directory where web pages are stored.

If a cache directory is set, and a request is made for a page that is stored
in the cache, the cache will be used.

If a cache directory is set, and a request is made for a page that is not
stored in the cache, the page contents will be stored in the cache.

If cache_directory is /tmp/cache, http://example.com/ will be stored in
/tmp/cache/example.com/Index\ page and http://example.com/foo/bar/baz.gif
will be stored in /tmp/cache/example.com/foo/bar/baz.gif

(The leafname "Index page" is used to denote that it was fetched from
a URL with a trailing slash, rather than a URL ending in /Index%20page
or /Index+page .)

No distinction is made between http and https, or any other URL protocols.

=cut

has 'cache_directory' => (
    is        => 'rw',
    isa       => 'WWW::Webcomic::CacheDir',
    predicate => 'has_cache_directory',
);

=item cached_file_path

The full filesystem path of the file where the page would be stored.
Undef if there is no cache_directory.

Lazy attribute; will create the requisite subdirectories, or die trying,
when called.

=cut

has 'cached_file_path' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Str',

    }
    if ($uri->query) {
        $components[-1] .= '?' . $uri->query;
    }
    return @components;
}

=item contents

The contents of the page. Lazy, so only retrieved when first requested,
and cached in memory for later use. Will die on errors, so be sure to wrap in
an eval block or Try::Tiny::catch etc.

=item canonical_url

A URI object for the page this page ultimately points to.

=cut

has 'canonical_url' => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'URI',
    lazy_build => 1,

    # If this is an object that has just fetched a live page,
    # let LWP do the work for us.
    # Confusingly, HTTP::Response->base returns the contents of e.g.
    # the <base> header tag, i.e. which page this page is pretending to be.
    # Or, if there's no such tag and we had a redirection, the page we
    # were redirected to.
    # Either way, it's the canonical URL for this page.
    if ($self->_has_http_response) {
        return $self->_http_response->base;
    }

    # OK, this is a cached response. If this is a straight file,

    # stored symlinks to tell us what the eventual URL was. In this case,
    # we've been fetched from a cached file, which is actually a symlink to
    # another file, so work out what the URL should be from the symlink
    # target.

    substr($eventual_url, 0, length($self->cache_directory)) = 'http://';
    return URI->new($eventual_url);
}

=item tree

An HTML::TreeBuilder object of the fetched page. Like L<contents>, lazy,
so if you haven't explicitly fetched the page yet, be ready for exceptions.
Deleted when the object goes out of scope, so you don't have to worry about
cleaning up explicitly.

=cut

has 'tree' => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => 'HTML::TreeBuilder',
    lazy_build => 1,
);

# This is Moose's version of DESTROY. DESTROY works as well, but you get
# warnings that Moose didn't override the standard DESTROY method which
# we can do without.

sub DEMOLISH {
    my ($self) = @_;

    if ($self->has_tree) {
